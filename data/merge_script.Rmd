```{r}
# This merges the cfimdb and base files so that they exist in one csv file

csfimdb <- read_delim("ids-cfimdb-train.csv")
base <- read_delim("ids-sst-train.csv")

# Transform labels of cfimdb
csfimdb$sentiment = ifelse(df_1$sentiment == 1, 4, 0)

df_merged <- rbind(base, csfimdb)
df_merged <- df_merged %>%
  select(id, sentence, sentiment)

# Make sure that csv is tab delimited
write.table(df_merged, "ids-sst-train-merged.csv", row.names = FALSE, sep="\t")
```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Cmd+Option+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Cmd+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file). 

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
