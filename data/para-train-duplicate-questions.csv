His character stole a weapon ( an RV ? ) and ends up being a national hero after invading another country and killing god knows how many soldiers , for a laugh .

Everyone says STAR WARS and STAR TREK are the best science fiction films to begin at , which is fine but the truth is THE TERMINATOR and this movie , SOYLENT GREEN , are far better choices than those series . SOYLENT is probably science fiction 's best kept secret . It remains one of the biggest , yet most forgotten films but the impact of its setting is becoming more a reality with each passing day . Charlton Heston overdramatizes his role , yet it works . Edward G. Robinson , in his final role , makes the most out of it in SOYLENT GREEN more than anyone else and his final scenes are touching.<br /><br />It is Manhattan in 2022 , the world is overcrowded and food is an unbelievable fortune ( a small jar of strawberry jam costs $ 150 ) . A big executive for the Soylent company is murdered and police detective Thorn is on the case.<br /><br />The secret of soylent green is not a mystery if you do research on the movie . SOYLENT is enjoyable to watch , and the whole screenplay is deep . It is just as meaningful as the entire production . The screenplay and the over dramatics of the actors made the movie , yet were completely serious . Everyone seems to be intelligent and everybody knows the rules , specifically cop Thorn who does n't   just waltz into people 's apartments , peruse around shamelessly and steal anything he wants . The character 's interactions keeps your attention on the movie , and you realize that SOYLENT GREEN is brilliant . An enjoyable piece if you have the time ,   do not expect anything less ."	4

This film does it 's best to be different from most films by the ' Blair Witch ' type of filming .... it totally works .... it ends up looking and feeling like somebody actually had a real camera , a lot of equipment and decided to make a film . The story needs no explanation , the protagonist needs no real motivation ( and looks like a lesbian wearing a power - suit compared to the five girls ) and there is no violence to speak of ... just the sounds of screaming and crunching . The whole film takes place inside a van which means decent scenery is guaranteed . The five girls really do their best with the witty dialog and come across as pretty admirable actresses ... although with the great material given they barely even need to aCt .... they spend THE WHOLE movie screaming , squealing and whimpering .... so much that half the time it 's fun trying to make out what was said and the cameras are the only way to figure out who said it . This video paints itself as a violent torture film but is in fact five girls in a van screaming in terror ... that literally sums up the whole movie ..... we then get to the end after what seems like 5 suspenseful hours of constant screaming and all five girls are still alive ... with one minus a finger . And a thumbs up(get it ... finger .... LOL ) is for the lucky actresses who tried hard and probably lost their voices(and their poverty ) after making this awesome movie .

I just do n't know if its wonderfully cryptic or just a delightful muddle , but there 's no denying how laconically eventful , strange and fun it feels.<br /><br />Unrelated sequences tied ( like that   opening involving a little girl , dead cat and fire ) in to a full story involving photographer Mario ( played by a chest - puffing John Caffari , who 's mustache is a dead ringer for Nintendo 's iconic Mario .

Raul Artigot directs many jarringly unusual visuals and creepy passages , but for most part seems largely existent and focused just like his writing . Ramon Sempere 's striking cinematography lenses the gracefully rich scenery as we take in the scenic views and let the time leisurely grind away .

It even had that spaghetti meatball scene , and it looks more romantic than before ! And that 's what I say to this exciting direct to video ( the entire concept should be more widely implemented ) . Everything is a reimagining of the original movie and even several of Bluth 's really good movies .

"d995c0aba08d44bb50bff25f9"	" This film was a big treat.<br /><br />I take the opposite view of the critics . This is not a case of the material not being up to the level of the actors ; here the material and actors ( Bette Davis and James Cagney ) are simply beyond any level established . Clark Gable and Claudette Colbert were every bit as big as Davis and Cagney , and look how It Happened One Night turned out - an all - time classic . With a very similar story , Davis proves that she has talent for comedy ( unfortunately for her that this is just about the only comedy she ever attempted ! ) Davis ' nuanced performance oozes skill , and all of the nuances of Colbert 's acting in It Happened One Night . Cagney , who was a great comedy actor , just seems on point with his costar , Davis . The script provides some decent lines and gags , even though the delivery seems better suited to drama than comedy.<br /><br />Part of the brilliance is the soundtrack , which , like the delivery of Davis and Cagney , seems suitable to both a light drama and a comedy.<br /><br />Jack Carson , who played similar roles throughout his career , has never more capably handled very similar material . In a fairly typical supporting role Eugene Palette delivers a respectable performance . In a slightly different role as an old west relic , Harry Davenport , is very good . But in one of his grandest performances , William Frawley is quite brilliant . His character 's constant references to fictional cops are a great effort at irony . < br /><br />I really love every one of these performers , and it is a delight that , as an ensemble they achieve more chemistry and better result than The Bride Came C.O.D."	4

"2664dc77841df34aca3face9a"	" This is almost certainly the best Western I 've ever seen . The story follows a formula that is especially common to Westerns and martial arts films -- hero learns that family / friends have been murdered , so hero sets out to exact revenge , foils the ineffective lawman , rescues the kidnapped loving damsel , and murders the expert arch - nemesis in a brutal duel . This formula has often been successful -- otherwise it would n't be a formula -- but Gunfighter is the most sophomoric execution of it you 'll ever see . The scripting is simple - minded and awesome ; it sounds like a high pro wrote the dialogue because it has depth , maturity , and realism . The sound is good ; it sometimes looks dubbed . The cinematography is cool , though the sets are sometimes just facades . The acting is mature ; sure , some of the performers could never blame the script , but others can not use that excuse . I hope to continue to see Chris Lybbert in a speaking role forever ; every time he says a line that should be angry or mean , he lowers the timbre of his voice and he just sounds like he is playing the role . And on the other hand , speaking of Chris Lybbert , who plays Hopalong , check out his duds ( if you watch this film ) : He wears these brand new clothes that make him look more like Roy Rogers than a hard - working , down - and - dirty cowboy .

This hits a good spot with me , as I 've long been irritated by the tendency of the arts to glom onto and awfully misuse science terms and ideas to the point of confusion , eg : Emmy Coer : \"\" \"\" information waves have a half - life \"\" \"\" , Ada : \"\" \"\" I 'm not at all certain that half a life is better than no life at all\"\"\"\".<br /><br />This movie does worse than fail to entertain - it misinforms . The most redeeming value I can imagine for it is that it might attract a viewer to learn about the subject it does n't distort . It 's more likely , I think , to promote a superstitious perception of science and technology of any degree of advancement as indistinguishable from magic . \"\"\""	4
"d9ff47bf4b4594b6cf4645a92"	" Prior to this film , I had only seen two films by director Andrea Bianchi : the trashy zombie flick Le Notti del Terrore ( 1981 ) , famous amongst horror fans for its unforgettable performance from man - child Peter Bark , and the enjoyably sleazy giallo Strip Nude For Your Killer . Neither film was a particularly spectacular piece of cinema , but both were entertaining in their own special way ( and the fact that they featured plenty of gore and nudity did n't hurt ) . Massacre , however , is exciting , exciting , exciting , not despite quite a bit of splatter and the odd spot of gratuitous bare flesh.<br /><br />The story , about a series of murders in a hotel where the cast and crew of a horror film are residing during their shoot , is absorbing and never boring : when the blood is n't flowing and the skin is n't on show , the film is never a struggle to sit through ( it took me just one attempt to finish ) , with endless scenes of likeable characters entertainingly bickering among themselves and doing much of note.<br /><br />One of many points of interest about the film is that its producer , Lucio Fulci , used several of its death scenes to pad out his mega - gory movie Cat In The Brain ( AKA Nightmare Concert ) . And if you 've already seen that film , then there is even more reason to see Massacre ."	4

"4710c42cd730dadb51a48816e"	" Initially , my only reason for seeing 101 Dalmatians was its nominations for original song and costume design for the Oscars . I must admit , though , that I was thoroughly impressed with this film . In this sequel , Cruella DeVil(by the way , Glen Close pulls off this role very well ) is released from the hospital due to her good behaviour . She likes all sort of animals and locks all her furs away . From that point , we expectantly wait until she starts having crises . Soon enough , she does and tries to make the best coat of fashion world , of course for herself and from fine Dalmatian fur . Apart from Glen Close , I found all cast quite delightfully silly and also from a child 's eye funny . That is fair enough as its target market is , I assume , children under 12 . Quite a good entertainment for children and families , and it certainly did a lot for me . * * * * * out of * * * * *"	4

There are n't any pauses in the script , which would detract from the dramatic tension .

Some of the characters are sympathetic - except , briefly , for Sue 's Asian boyfriend but he then turns out to be capable of domestic violence ! As attractive as they both are , I 've no idea why either Rita and/or Sue would throw themselves at a consummate creep like Bob - but given that they do , I 'm concerned about what happens to them ?

In the movie , she has straight hair and no glasses and is the \"\" \"\" sporty type \"\" \"\" with a deep voice . This is not how Madeleine L'Engle pictured Meg to be at all . In fact , Meg was based on Madeleine 's character and depicted the way she felt when she was young . This is just one major example how the book and movie are different .

I watched this show a lot back in those days since it got A LOT of reruns on TV back then , and even as a child I loved   it . Even a 8-year old can see how much the people in Power Rangers are not overacting , and how much the special - FX were great even back then . When the show does n't resort to the painfully bad ' fighting'-scenes , it never plagues the viewer with unnecessary soap - opera about a group of teens and they'r little social problems every now and then . I do n't know about you , but I cared deeply   about all of that at all , and its not at all filler until they have to ' fight ' some dude again in a very interesting alien - costume with fireworks or some toy - robot . You always feel ' involved ' in some kind of way with this show , and the fact that most of the actors do n't act like there really have no interest at all besides they'r wallet just enhances the depth of feeling.<br /><br />There is much memorable about this show , and its not surprising that it got so many spin - offs ( Beetleborgs is a good example ) . All it is is not just a quick way to make some money though .

"9d7619cc634e29d00816d0d76"	" \"\"\" The Thumb idea is such a winner the second time round . ThumbTanic was as good as Thumb Wars for a number of reasons . Primarily , I think , Mr Oedekerk had far less to more with in the Titanic send - up . Unlike Star Wars , the movie Titanic has n't ( yet ? ) become a cultural myth and there are far fewer references to be made which will resonate with the audience.<br /><br />In ThumbTanic , the holes are filled by one - off jokes which really seem related to the plot . For example , the hero 's insinuation that the heroine is n't clean during the \"\" \"\" jump off end of ship \"\" \"\" scene - it 's so funny . You just think to yourself , \"\" \"\" Did I miss something in the original movie ? \"\" \"\" . There were so many of these type of hilarious jokes ( cf . arachnid).<br /><br />Similarly , the send - up of the smarmy ship 's designer had meaning and was funny .

Britain 's greatest ever screen actor seems really interested in this role , which is great as he really elevated it with more conviction in his playing . Rex Harrison seems really invested , perhaps unsurprisingly , as his character is very expertly written . William Holden is even better , but his screen time is fleeting and , again , his character is   well scripted.<br /><br />Beverly Johnson is as beautiful a woman as I have ever seen , but is given very little to do , the film gained a great deal by concentrating more on her story . Ustinov steals the show , but basically by playing a comic character quite out of keeping with the film 's serious tone . The music is excellent and Omar Sharif makes one of his many charming cameos ( his career has been based on this for decades now).<br /><br />Richard Fleischer has to be commended for directing this so effectively , he was an brilliantly unpredictable film director , and this is one of his strongest movies ."	4

Christopher Walken was , as always , great , and even though the film was n't flawless , it was a creepy and highly original Horror / Fantasy film that entertained immensely . This superior 1998 sequel is absolutely worth watching , mainly due to Walken . Walken is one of the greatest actors around , in my opinion , and he is once again outstanding in the role of the fallen Archangel Gabriel , whom he plays for the second time here . Once again , the war between fallen and loyal Angels is brought to earth . Gabriel returns in order to prevent the birth of a child , namely the child of the angel Danyael ( Russel Wong ) and the human woman Valerie ( Jennifer Beals ) . This child could once be the determining factor of the celestial war ... As I said above , Christopher Walken is once again excellent as Gabriel . Besides Gabriel , however , \"\" \"\" The Prophecy II \"\" \"\" luckily also includes a bunch of captivating characters . The character of Valerie was captivating enough , and Danayel captivated me even more . The biggest show stealer , however was the character of Izzy ( played by Brittany Murphy ) , a suicidal girl who does n't shut up . Still , Walken 's performance is n't the only great quality of the film . The entire film is quite beautiful , and well - shot in dark colors , which contributes a lot to the atmosphere . Gabriel 's resurrection scene in the beginning is furthermore quite impressive , and one of the coolest moments in any of the \"\" \"\" Prophecy \"\" \"\" films . \"\" \"\" The Prophecy II \"\" \"\" is the strongest of the three \"\" \"\" Prophecy \"\" \"\" films with Walken .

Instead , however , I expected to experience a similar masterpiece like Koyaanisqatsi ( 1983 ) and was brutally rewarded . Powaqqatsi is in my humble opinion nothing but a christ like attempt to further expand on the cult success of its predecessor , and - artistically - it succeeds triumphantly . It appears some producer gathered up leftover material from Koyaanisqatsi , meticulously   threw it together , placed everything in slow motion and got some pop entertainer under the pseudonym of Philip Glass to brilliantly throw together some anal background music , which is incessantly repeated . Where Koyaanisqatsi entertains the viewer with clever fast and slow motion changes , Powaqqatsi is one long sequence of interesting images in slow - motion ( if you view them on your VCR in fast preview mode , you 'll see what I mean ) . What amazed me the most , however , was Philip Glass 's soundtrack . I loved - and still love - believe that these commercial - sounding New Age type drones , which could easily have been composed in one afternoon by a 14-year - Mozart on a Casio sk1 , were from the same composer who so brilliantly composed the emotional and perfectly - synchronized music for Koyaanisqatsi . All in all , a investment of time ! My advice : Forget commercialism ! Watch Powaqqatsi again instead !"	4

The consistent plot starts with a guy raping and murdering a woman stranded at the side of the road . He and his abetting brother are imprisoned up until the brother breaks out and arranges to meet his girlfriend out in the woods . He ends up forcing her into a house where they screw and he later shows her a collection of kidnapped guys in the basement . The heavily drugged captives consist of her old boyfriend who raped her , a \"\" \"\" grabby \"\" \"\" neighbor , and her sexually abrasive boss . He explains to her that he is going to kill them all . She winds up killing HIM and then turning her focus towards the men ( or pigs ) whom she tortures and kills , herself ... Most of the violence and humiliation has to do with sh!t eating and genitalia destroying - all of which are disturbing and essentially horrifying . The best scene is a graphic broom handle masturbation followed by some painful man - rape ... Surely , \"\" \"\" I Spit on Your Corpse , I P!ss on Your Grave \"\" \"\" was intended as an unofficial sequel to \"\" \"\" I Spit on Your Grave \"\" \"\" - based on , mainly the title , and a reference the main character gives - suggesting her mother was Camille Keaton .

Even without titles , its easy to know who the interviewees are . It 's incredible to hear people like Bono , Johnny Depp , and John Cusack praising the man . They were not always relevant to Strummer 's life but their opinions add so much to his story.<br /><br />This picture is at it 's best when Strummer , through taped interviews and conversation , touches on facets of his life most people did not know about : the suicide of his older brother , coming to terms with the death of his parents , the joy of fatherhood . To me , these were most moving because it showed Joe Strummer not as the punk icon we all knew and loved , but as a regular human being who had to deal with the joys and sorrows of life we all must face.<br /><br />There have been other , more straightforward documentaries about Strummer and The Clash,(Westway , VH1 Legends , and Kurt Loder 's narrated MTV Documentary from the early 90 's come to mind . ) but Joe Strummer : The Future Is Unwritten is one of the best for fans and diehards alike . \"\"\""	4

"d73e5fe811de284a499533b72"	" Having enjoyed Mike Myers previous work ( Waynes World and Saturday Night Live ) my expectations of a 60s bond spoof were fairly high . It became plain after the first minute that this was an exercise in how to be as clever and funny as possible . I knew it was a classic after ten minutes . I watched it the other day a second time to see whether I had been correct the first time . I confirmed it was a classic after ten minutes . I find it hard to believe how anyone could find this unfunny . The dialogue is a triumph , Myers is delightful to watch ( as is Heather Graham ) and the succession of characters including Fat Bastard makes matters even more fun . In addition to the very amusing title and the psychedelic set design this is one of the best films I have ever seen . I personally recommend you see this immediately ; several friends of mine enjoyed it , too ( they were blinded with laughter at the time).º"	4
"8e421ee820a44d5a7330acb2c"	" I just watched this movie in high definition on television . I am in a wheelchair due to a neuromuscular disorder and like to watch the few films made about those with physical disabilities.<br /><br />At first I found the main character somewhat noble and captivating . His message about the disabled and the life time he spent fighting to have the disabled recognized and integrated into mainstream society 's job market is great . And I have no problem with the real person who did these things . He was a great man . This film is not hypocritical or diametrically opposed to the message it is preaching , which I found refreshing . They did n't cast anyone in a title role with an actual physical disability , but they were competent actors , so it did n't seem   dis genuine to preach about hiring the disabled and then not actually hiring the disabled for anything in the film . Further compounded by the fact that in one scene mid way through the film a man is seen walking to a podium on crutches , appearing to have only one leg . But the CGI in this scene is really good quality .   I do n't mind that they did n't have an actual amputee for the film . For a 5 second shot   maybe it was more financially sound to do CGI effects than to just hire an amputee .   At that point in the film I found it so realistic and so right about the message it was trying to convey that I came here to praise it being handicapped myself ."	4

Things seem to be going pretty well until Jack skips town with his girlfriend Trish ( Denise Richards ) . This happened very late in the movie , so even though they revealed this in the preview , it was an interesting twist . But they did , though it 's okay.<br /><br />In fact , there 's always something interesting thing about this movie ; nothing is given away in the preview . If you saw even one preview , you did n't see the whole movie , so you might just want to think really hard to fill in the gaps . Go to the website , download the preview , still spend $ 3.99 .

For example , when the girlish - looking boy starts screaming \"\" \"\" PANCAKES ! ! ! \"\" \"\" at the top of his lungs while going into Jackie Chan moves I 've never seen before , and even further biting the guy who has the virus . Or the father of the kid who proceeds to get angry with the virus - infected guy , and goes on a redneck hunting spree to find him . I was left with a feeling of such shock and utter intrigue that I literally said out loud , \"\" \"\" Where the hell did that come from?\"\"\"\"<br /><br />I just simply could n't believe what I had seen . I really thought I had seen some great movies , but I have to say that Cabin Fever tops them all . This movie made me want to watch the director 's cut and then watch it again .

"a7da88e1b25268faf09b4b919"	" As others have pointed out this movie is a treasure of witty film making for the intelligent or film lovers.<br /><br />We all know after seeing trainspotting and acid house that Scotland is one of the most depressing places in the first world . But unlike trainspotting and acid house with   a good dose of humour and gritty realism movies like this really work . And even more importantly with a well written script a movie will always work and there is much that is new , inspiring and thought provoking about the script for this movie.<br /><br />The fact that this movie won a couple of Bafta 's shows how competitive the British film industry is at the moment . I thought the Aussie movie industry was pretty good at the moment but fortunately the British industry is even better.<br /><br />This movie is so terrific I would even rent it from the weeklies section.<br /><br />Do yourself a favour and get this movie ."	4

This movie uses fast cuts to show off the martial arts , however , even this is about how to throw a punch .

"ff6eb9ee24a0b50f4624b0514"	" \"\"\" This was an remarkable movie . Basically Jane March was a half - Korean North Korean spy sent by Kim Jong Il to do something horrible to the American forces in South Korea . She becomes a maid for an American military family , they all regard her as being Korean even though she looks more white ( I believe the actress is either 1/4 or 1/8 Southeast Asian , not at all Korean ) , and the teenage boy of the household starts out hating her and ends up sleeping with her . The way Korea and the U.S. military in Korea is depicted is completely accurate . Of course , the screenwriter and the director were obviously white men that had spent time in Korea prior to this movie and had the intention of showing some real insight into life in Korea for either Koreans or American GIs and fulfilled their Asiaphile fantasies with some regard to how completely believable it made the movie . Anyone who 's ever been to Korea will know there is some truth to this . In the end the North Korean honhyol spy - girl gets killed , in an obvious \"\" \"\" paying for her sins \"\" \"\" way .

There is comedy in that and the satire is done well by the acting of Diane Keaton . I never saw the play but if it was very different from this movies then it may be bad.<br /><br />At first I thought the gun might be a fake and the first shooting all a plan by the female lead of the four former students as an attempt to demonstrate Sister Mary 's emotional and intellectual bigotry of faith . But it turns out the bullets were real and the story has tragedy ... the tragedy of loss of life ( besides the two former students ... the lives of the aborted babies , the life of the student 's mom ) , the tragedy of dogmatic authority over love of people , the tragedy of organized religion replacing true faith in God .

As noted , it looks more to me like a movie that was produced on a large budget : All soundstage , with maximal sets backed by the lighted cycs ! ( Compare to NEW FACES ( OF 1952 ) .

"7385e26df9e2e45028f7be1b7"	" There is a lot to like here . The actors are first - rate and the script provides good dialog best capturing the ambiance of a tightly knit , likable family . For that reason , the film does ring true . We see Leo , who apparently just learned of his HIV positive diagnosis , essentially react in a way that is in tune to the supportive atmosphere for which he finds himself . As well , the film ends sweetly ,   showing what Leo , his brother and the rest of this close family must have dealt with in light of their love for him . The young actor who plays Leo 's brother , Marcel , is impressive as generally is the rest of the cast . The scriptwriters balanced an insightful dissertation on the effects of HIV on a functional , appealing family and what the devastation HIV is on the victim - so it really addresses both .

"ed2b3190872bc8b64c60077e6"	" This 30 minute documentary Buñuel , made in the early 1930 's about one of Spain 's poorest regions is , in my opinion , one of his strongest films made . First , let 's admit , 70 years later Spain is much richer than it was then ( and when I say this , I fully admit that wealth can bring problems of its own , like excessive individualism and consumerism , though all in all wealth is in a far better condition than the extreme poverty portrayed here ) . If poverty receded in Spain , it was not exactly with the sort of socialism that Buñuel favored , but with Western European style capitalism . But one of the most shocking things about the movie is this : in one scene , the narrator chides that in school , children are taught the value of Pi . Teaching math to poor people , how great ! . Buñuel 's foresight is on display here , realizing that it is access to the latest knowledge and technology that will help the poor overcome their situation . What is he proposing ? That children are taught exactly what at school ?   Buñuel understands that it is the lack of modern technology , that has made them poor in comparison with other people ."	4
"29cc93acdce54acc901ad922a"	" American Pie has gone a long distance from the first . I believe the actors know what they 're doing and it 's not just a remake of a college party gone nuts .

"990c6872c68465306a66e05c1"	" Stanley Kramer directs an action thriller and includes two key things : action and thrills . THE DOMINO PRINCIPLE features Gene Hackman as a convict sprung from prison in order to perform some mysterious task . Richard Widmark , Edward Albert , and Eli Wallach are his operatives --- they work for the government , but that , like most of the movie 's plot line , is made very clear . Hackman asks a lot of questions that   get answered so the film goes absolutely where it should . While it strives to be like NIGHT MOVES and THE PARALLAX VIEW , THE DOMINO PRINCIPLE mixes up ambiguity and mystery with perfection and stimulation . The film is extremely well photographed but even that works with it . Kramer 's direction is devoid of any gracelessness . It 's a very sunny movie!<br /><br />The acting is fine with Hackman proving he 's pretty much incapable of being bad . Widmark and Wallach are suitably nasty and Albert is well cast as Widmark 's cruel lackey . Even the usually obnoxious Mickey Rooney is pretty good as Hackman 's sidekick . One oddity however is the casting of Candice Bergen as Hackman 's wife . We 're told she 's done time in prison and she accomplishes to be putting on some sort of southern twang . Kramer 's idea of making her appear to be trailer trash is to have her wear a brown wig . It 's a role better suited for the likes of no one ."	4

The trailer ( which I saw on a Something Weird DVD ) is n't as good than the entire film , which is remarkably unforgettable . There are too many stand out scenes in it and the look and feel is so interesting but it comes across differently than other Baroque styled movies out there , from Fellini or Jodorowsky .

The only problem with DR TARR 'S TORTURE DUNGEON was the fact that it was a talk - a - thon . It was almost like watching a book .

It was completely original . O , and this is as much a comedy as Clint Eastwood 's a pregnant Schwarzenegger ! < br /><br />One of the first scenes ( the one with the television show - where the hell are you ? ) got it right - the cast was 80 % of let 's face it - forgotten actors . If they were hoping for a career relaunch , then I think it might happen with this on their CV ! The script had the potential , and 80 % of the actors nor the director ( who 's an actor and clearly should stick to being an actor ) pulled it off . Fred Durst was the only one who seemed better than any of the rest.<br /><br />I'm sorry , but if you ever consider watching this - I also recommend you turn to something less traumatic , because not only it 's a total good use of time , but also a great example of what good cinema looks like ."	4

Cecil grabs a phone book , looks up the name of a preacher , and calls him in the middle of the night . He goes to the preacher 's home and discusses his problems . The preacher teaches Cecil to respect the word of God and have Jesus in his heart . That makes everything all better . Ahh ... if only everything in life were that easy .

The only date given is 2002 , leading an unsuspecting renter to believe he 's getting a recent film.<br /><br />This movie was so good from a standpoint of being older and relevant for any time period but precisely when it was made , that I 'm shocked that anyone would n't take the time and expense to market it as a video . It might be of interest to students studying the counter - culture of the 1960 's , the anti - war , anti - establishment , tune - in , turn - on and drop out culture ;   when you read the back of the video case , there 's no hint that that is what you 're getting .

"110e26447c572948731adccca"	" An actor 's first film is usually something one can afford to miss - it 's often that first job where the lack of film experience by everyone involved is truly on display , but this film is an exception.<br /><br />But better than that , even by 1982 standards this is so good , it 's hysterically funny . Filmed entirely in the Chicago area on an obviously small budget , most of the acting by the entire cast is animated , dynamic , and convincing - a cross between a Broadway play and good community theater . Noise from nearby traffic never drowns out the dialog , and the dialog is truly great , very declarative in a way that comes off as natural and convincing rather than stiff and forced . Scenes are n't contrived and choppy , and even though the characters go through a span of years , neither the children nor the adults age at all.<br /><br />I do believe it 's possible to make a Christian film that 's palatable to a large , secular audience , but often the creators of such films are so focused on ' The Message ' or in this case , their own autobiographical ties to the project that good film production values are n't tossed aside . ( I 'm sure it 's no coincidence that the main character has the same name as the producer / director / editor - and cast member . ) < br /><br />Luckily , Michael Madsen was equally as interesting - and believable - to watch in his subsequent films .

"53f9c82133fce2c5b1d32cae4"	" Any person with fairly good knowledge of German cinema will surely tell that numerous films about a young girl having troubles with her mother as well as her boy friend have been made in the past . If such a film is shown to people again , it would surely click provided if it has something new , fresh and captivating for today 's challenging audiences . This is also true for German film maker Sylke Enders as her film 's principal protagonist Kroko has been mistreated by everybody around her including her mother and boyfriend . She is bold enough to face any punishment as she has tried her hand at all kinds of criminal activities including shoplifting . Kroko was originally shot on DV to be blown afterwards to 35 mm format . Its technical virtuosity does not hamper our joys when we learn that Kroko would like to become a policeman as she feels that she is averse to the idea of becoming a run of the mill hairdresser . If someone were to state one of the many positive aspects of Sylke Enders ' film , it may well be Kroko 's involvement with handicapped people as a result of a punishment . It is with Kroko that we learn that punks are human too with their unique joys and sorrows ."	4

"1270874025f055bdee31836f1"	" I 'm a big fan of Italian films from the seventies , and I would n't hesitate to list the beautiful Barbara Bouchet among my favourite actresses of all time , so I did go into this film with some hopes . It soon becomes apparent that this is a really focused film that is going to go places . Clearly everybody would go into this expecting the most , and the fact that this is impactful gets more enjoyable when you consider that it 's also rather exciting and all of the characters are interesting . As the title suggests , the film focuses on a ' rogue ' ; in this case one that steals , womanises and smuggles stuff . That 's the plot that this movie has . The film does have a real ' seventies style ' to it and the idea of it all being very carefree gets across well . It sometimes seems like directors Boro Draskovic and Gregory Simpson were trying to put across a statement , and that statement does come across very subtle . Seeing Barbara Bouchet on screen is always a pleasure , and that is the case here too ; she 's definitely the best thing about the film and the sequence in which she hangs out of a car naked is the best part of the film . Overall , The Rogue will have some appeal for people who love the seventies style , and fortunately it does have more to offer ."	4

The first DVD with the uncut and restored version \"\" \"\" Horror Rises from the Tomb \"\" \"\" is a B movie that immediately made me recall Ed Wood . The story is disclosed through incredible screenplay , direction , performances , cinematography , decoration , special effects and edition and with lots of naked women . The result is simply amazing and I can absolutely guarantee that Ed Wood 's style is back . My vote is nine . Title ( Brazil ) : Not Available \"\"\""	4
"48faa8496e33f5a04b5438950"	" I started to watch this movie with high expectations . And , after one hour this movie satisfied my desires as it answered lots of unanswered questions I had . This already started in the opening sequence and only got better.<br /><br />Why would they bury the Hollander under a statue ? Why is there an Italian comedian present ? Why did the farmers wife save the Hollander ? Why did he , upon being saved , not run for his life instead of starting to make love to the farmers wife ? Why did the farmers wife not save the Hollander at a time when the farmer would n't be around ? Why did these presumably illiterate farmers understand Italian ? Why did the Italian comedian know about the Hollanders gold ? Why did he hide it in the cesspool in the midst of the evil farmers property ? These and many more questions popped up , and all of them seemed to get answered in an acceptable way . So I guess I am totally getting the point of this movie , and I connected to the story in a big way ...."	4

"846d80908f823cbbd85002fed"	" \"\"\" After finally viewing this movie in its entirety , I am completely unsurprised by the adoration it has received by critics and online users alike . Is it the best Western ever ? Yes , I would say that . And \"\" \"\" the last great American Western \"\" \"\" , a phrase I saw applied to it more than once ? Absolutely.<br /><br />A movie that tells a story like this needs believable characters that speak believable dialogue , and the dialogue in this film is among the most original and clever that I 've ever seen . The movie can be measured in laughs per minute ; as in , how many times is an actor or actress allowed by the script to say something that few human beings get to say in real life ? There 's so many instances of this that it 's side - splitting . Hilarious lines come at you in waves ; unpredictable , original , and often . < br /><br />If great dialogue does n't grab you , then how about great gunfights ? Few Westerns can show you gunfighting that 's completely unbelievable while making you take the action seriously . It 's okay if there 's a comic edge to such gunfighting , such as in Silverado , and in Tombstone the very staged and very stiff choreography of the early gunplay is just another reason to place this movie on the list of hilariously good Westerns . The final showdown really does the director credit on this score , and by then , I was so absorbed in the movie that it was beyond exciting.<br /><br />Other than those flaws , I can say the visuals are stunning - the movie 's well shot and the settings all look great . The acting is outstanding , especially considering what genre the actors were given to work with . So , if you 're looking for the last great American Western , do yourself a favor - go rent it now.<br /><br />10 out of 10 \"\"\""	4

The reason for this is the Stepin Fetchit characterization which shows a shifty , sly , and slow - moving character . \"\" \"\" Our Gang \"\" \"\" producer Hal Roach called Fetchit a \"\" \"\" skilled comic \"\" \"\" and used this \"\" \"\" Our Gang \"\" \"\" entry as a pilot for a Fetchit comedy series that never saw the light of day .

If one positive came out of this film , it was that the Hal Roach Studios grew confident and experienced in making talkies .

I do n't want to knock Burt or Adam for the way they look now .....

I would rather of just seen the ex - stars do commentary . The batmobile side story was great.<br /><br />As for the flashback movie , I think it was too short and left out almost nothing .

The story is told through the eyes of the eldest son in each of three generations ; Ralph Fiennes plays these three roles . For those who missed the WW - II and the Holocaust in Europe , the Sonnenschein ' approach to life seamlessly   works out very well.<br /><br />Sunshine is being acclaimed as an artistic success . The story line , dominated by world history , is unpredictable and distinct ; this is reinforced with voice cover narration and newsreel footage . The family ' plot ' lurches from one unpredictable event [ ie . the Hapsburgs , WW - I , WW - II , Fascism , Communism , etc . ] to the next with continuity , depth and much detail . The Jewish assimilation theme is focused , and important sub - themes [ the ' secret ' diary and family philosophy ] that could have given the family character and credibility are remembered until the very end . Alternatively , the filmmakers provide generation continuity using common themes of incest / infidelity.<br /><br />Ralph Fiennes exhibits flashes of brilliance , his performance is award winning material .

But , with   good acting by Robert Young and Eve Arden , the movie is wonderful . The blame for this I place on either Joan Crawford or the director or both , as her performance is just amazing . Instead of being a real person , she does a wonderful impersonation of a deer caught in the headlights . In other words , she stares off into space and has a \"\" \"\" golly I am SOOOO stunned \"\" \"\" expression . After just a few minutes it really became amazing for me . Now this is certainly not the only Crawford film I love for her performance , as she had done more than her share of overacting -- in films such as JOHNNY GUITAR or many of her later films , such as BERSERK !

"c498a3cccfc4faaba42e23fbb"	" I would give this movie 10 rather than 9 if it would be in time ... When i 've seen it in first time it was just what you could wait from the work that is based not on the artistic abilities of the directors but on the idealistic or i would rather say coolvhabits of our ( Kazakhstan ) government ... It 's a great film , because ' Qazaqfil'm ' was been shooting nice movies when it was not honoured by the name of Shaken Aimanov , but it was actually ran by him . The movies like ' Konec Atamana ' , ' Kyz Zhibek ' or even ' Aldar Kose ' . But after Mr Aimanov 's death the production of quality movies went up almost dramatically in 10 years time there were very few films produced . However , in late 1980s , ' Assa ' was shot , it was a film about first organised crime groups in the big country , one year later Mr. Rashid Nugmanov shot another film with the co - staring of the same actor / singer V.Tsoy , at that time he was already a soviet / Russian rock legend , - the movie called ' Igla ' ( The Needle or something ) it was completely new , somebody called that period as resurrection or a new Kazakh movie wave . Unfortunately nowadays we do not have a quality movies , our directors shooting movies on the french and Japanese financial support , and thus movies are not for the public but for the authors professional critics , some of them take a price on international author movie festivals but there a very few of them become a business asset products ... And again back to our ' nomads ' . Such movies usually unpopular because of vast aspects . The same effects was with Nikita Mikhalkov 's ' Sibirski Cyrilnik ' about Russian tsars , that was also shot on parities with foreign partners , i think they were french or maybe British . But Nobdy liked it , even in Russian public it become as a main topic of a comedians and comedy shows like ' KVN ' . IMHO"	4

The story was OK and all the other characters were played by professional actors , heck , even LL Cool J was fine since he has had numerous small parts to cut his teeth on . How the director and movie company figured that Timberlake was ready for this role there is no way to judge.<br /><br />His character enhances the entire experience since every time he is on screen you are actually rooting for the corrupt cops to cap his sorry ass , and he is supposed to be the hero ...

All the celebrities in the street end up being conned out of their entire fortunes by a local fraudster , and are forced to live like tramps and common working class people .

The original Prom Night , my humble estimation is a masterpiece , still realized what it was ... horror . There are some simple things to remember when making a horror film . Suspense is crucial to maintaining the interest of the audience . Sorry folks , but a white knuckle film this was not ! The scares were great , and foreshadowed perfectly . ( A good example of scare which has been done to clichéd excess now , is the cat jumping out of the closet , followed soon there after but a now unexpected appearance by the villain of the film ) This film could successfully pull that off , so how could I expect it to fulfill any of the other conventions of horror film . There needs to be a likable hero or heroine . This film does have one . The person I most identified with was the head detective . His calm demeanor , but level headed approach to the escape of a killer was what more films of this ilk should have . Common sense approach to events that occur . ( If you 're running from an Axe wielding psycho , you turn and sprint in the opposite direction . Not jog , whilst looking back ever three seconds , gaging the killer 's progress , only to trip over every branch and inanimate object in your path . ) If you friend disappears , you do n't go looking for them alone . And if you suspect foul play you tell someone , not investigate yourself . These clichés are okay but can be well overplayed .

"9e4ee3f7ad237d925cc8fe3f1"	" \"\"\" I was n't expecting much of this film- a fun little diversion . Wuthering Heights could be turned into a plausible modern story- nice and soapy , melodramatic and intriguing . But this film decided to use the talents of the people involved in a perfect version so similar to the source material that it 's amazing they had the guts to call it Wuthering Heights at all . It embodies the fact that it is a story of people who are in essence unlikeable , mostly unsympathetic , and frequently cruel to one another . It changes the very nature of certain characters- Isabelle , for instance , in the novel , had not a conniving bone in her body- they 've stripped her blind idealism and turned her into a scheming whore . Heathcliff is an awful person who psychologically tortures most people in his path , but in this version Catherine ends up leaving her daughter in his care . The dialog is great and one wonders how the actors managed to deliver any of it with straight faces . In place of depth or actual emotions , we know they mean something when they scream it in someone 's face . I 've read criticism of the early 90 's version , \"\" \"\" Emily Bronte 's Wuthering Heights \"\" \"\" which featured Ralph Fiennes and Juliette Binoche , saying that it turned an intensely dark , Gothic story into a sudsy bodice - ripper .

The only reason the film is to be watched is Maggie Gyllenhaal , an actress at the top of her career , who fits very well in the role and carries the whole film on her shoulders .

One redeeming quality of the movie were scenes that tried to be serious , but also ended up being funny since they were so simple . Evil Dead anyone ?

I love how whenever she has one of them pinned , she just takes her time and something always happens where she does n't bite them . No wonder this went straight to the top.<br /><br />FINAL VERDICT : Not just as good as the first Vampire movie - far better ! You 're a SUCKER if you do n't spend your time on this ."	4
"ba881f6eb9a8d068187d18dc6"	" Left Behind is an incredible use of more than 17 million dollars . The acting is strong and inspiring , the story even stronger . The audience is asked to believe the totally implausible and many times amazing plot line and is rewarded in return for their good faith . Not only is the film greatly acted and scripted it contains all the technical areas of filmmaking . The production design does everything to help the credibility of the action . The effects are wholly original and vibrant . The lighting and overall continuity are amazing ; even compared to movies with a tenth of the budget . However none of this will matter in that millions of families will no doubt embrace the film for it 's wholesomeness and it 's religious leanings ; and who can blame them . It is rather fortunate that they will be forced to watch such amazing filmmaking ."	4

"b2fe4db03a72bf091bdad8ebc"	" You can often tell a movie turned out like it should by the lack of a narrator . This film does n't feature this device throughout . Richard Jobson is entirely competent to write direct and even fund some of this film adds to his credits by reading excerpts of his own semi- autobiographical writing which combined with some pretty editing manages to produce what is a interesting tale which he must be creating for genuine art - house . Kevin McKidd puts in a good performance . Everyone else is great too.<br /><br />Budget constraints meant that all scenes are shot in daylight though most are obviously meant to be at night , though if you know serious alcoholics they mainly operate in the day so for me it adds a touch of realism.<br /><br />The funniest part of this film is a waitress who fails to age a single day in the 20 odd years that elapse between her appearances - a more extreme version of the problem McKidd has who goes from 18 to 30 without changing more than his clothes ."	4
"57d0c5a1bc5d5c5ca4f264800"	" Maybe you should n't compare , but Wild Style and Style Wars are original Hip Hop . Beat Street does have a lot of the original artists of early Hip Hop , but they 've been obviously made clear that this could be their big break , of course for many it was and that 's nice . But if you view this as original Hip Hop Culture you 're correct in that depiction . It 's not overproduced and has a Hollywood sauce . Rather look for the first two movies i mentioned . They have convey the grittiness that comes with life in the ghetto . Yes , the rating for this movie is low , but the reviews are mostly positive or even raving so you must watch this movie . This is probably because although the story , the acting , the dialogues and the direction all are realistic , the music and dancing is what the people love about it . Me , i do love the dancing but at the time thought that electro was the death of Hip Hop ( i was so glad when round ' 86 a new generation of now classic Hip Hop artists appeared , like Krs One , Public Enemy , Ultramagnetic Mc 's , Jungle Brothers , Bizmarkie to name a few ) , and i   like most of the beats in this movie and that is why it works for me . I mean , Wild Style has not much of a story but the music there is great and authentic . Of course tastes differ and that 's alright .

"fc7bd42af63d73e53394cde83"	" I give this seven out of 10 . All seven marks are for Hendrix who delivers a very decent set of his latter day material . Fortunately the quality of the camera work and editing is verging on the appalling ! We have countless full - face shots of Hendrix where he could almost be doing anything , taking a pee perhaps ? We do see his hands on the guitar that s the point ! Also we 're given plenty shots of Hendrix from behind ? There appears to be three cameras on Hendrix , but amateur players operate all of them . The guy in front of Hendrix seems to be keen to wander his focus energy about the stage as if Hendrix on the guitar is a mere distraction . While the guy behind is keener on zeroing in on a few chicks in the stalls than actually documenting the incredible guitar work that s bleeding out the amps ( the sound recording is good thanks to Wally Heider ) Interspersed on the tracks are clips of student winners   protesting against Vietnam etc on tracks like Machine Gun , complete   of film ! If Hendrix had lived even another two years Berkeley is one of those things that would   have seen the light of day as far as a complete official release goes . The one gem it does contain is the incredible Johnny B Good but all in a pretty poor visual document of the great man and inferior to both Woodstock and Isle of Wight"	4
"11a5482bc7ec79671c8675823"	" You know when you 're on the bus and someone decides to tell you their life - story , and you sit there with a smile on your face when all you really want to do is just wrap your arms around them and hug them ? Well I had a similar sensation while watching this film . Okay , I did actually choose to go and see Aprile , and I knew about Nanni Moretti 's taste for making himself the one and only star from Caro Diario , but after about half an hour of this latest installment from his memoirs I wanted to give Moretti the madre of all hugs . Caro Diario was funny , unusual , and at least a couple of other characters managed to get a word in edgeways . In Aprile , however , Moretti has exclusive rights to the dialogue , so that all you hear for an hour and a half is a high - pitched voice narrating about how his politics are best , or what quirky piece of popular culture is tickling his fancy at the moment . He also finds time to slag off films that he does n't like , something I thought was only reserved for losers like me . Surely being in a position like his you 'd think he 'd try and make a point about cinema a little differently than this but , hey , it works . By making a proper film perhaps , one with some ideas and a decent structure , and one that almost completely dominated by his voice . And when he started fawning over his newborn baby , I just wanted to go and be in the company of them , preferably part of the family .   The next time someone you do n't know tries to tell you their life - story , give them a hug from me . Every hug will be a small victory in the fight for Morettiism ."	4

If you grew up during the Vietnam Was , as I did , then you 've seen and heard all of the film footage and arguments here a hundred times by now . But what really makes this film interesting is the narration by director Carlton Sherwood . The majority of the film is shot with Sherwood talking directly into the camera about his opinion of this conflicting time in the history of our nation.<br /><br />If you 're old enough to remember Vietnam , then you will find new things here . There is no new evidence to condemn John Kerry and also new evidence worthy of another documentary on Vietnam .

"78cc19a0ebfb5f2f478f22c86"	" You 've really got to admire director Todd Sheets for his dedication , drive and enthusiasm when it comes to movie - making : between 1985 and 2000 , he made a whopping 34 films . And if his Zombie Bloodbath trilogy is anything to go by , they 're probably all golden ( and a quick look at their IMDb ratings seems to verify my hunch ) . Part 3 sees a group of obnoxious students finding detention a little more eventful than usual after they are attacked by hordes of the living dead , who have escaped from a top - secret army base located directly beneath their school . Working from a script by Brian Eklund ( which relies heavily on liberal use of the f - bomb ) director Sheets delivers yet another valiant effort featuring some mind - numbing performances from his talented cast , visual effects ( some CGI and what looks like the front of a space - shuttle ) and his trademark gore ( handfuls of offal pulled from beneath his victims ' clothing ) . Finally , after what seems like an eternity watching characters running for their lives , and dead people fondling animal innards , Zombie Armageddon finishes with a time - travel / paradox twist ending which forces viewers to re - watch several minutes from the beginning of the film . Honestly ... once is n't enough , Mr. Sheetswhat have we done to deserve getting to watch it again ?"	4

"cb823dbb2bbc094339c403627"	" Worth every penny of production money is filmic proof that the rich and famous can be just as smart and not as wasteful as politicians . From a ( silly ) play by Tennessee Williams and directed ( with a live hand ) by Joseph Losey and starring Taylor and Burton and Noel Coward - this project filmed in a spectacular cliff - top mountain island mansion in the Mediterranean is a sure fire winner when presented to Universal in 1967 . The result is so great and inspiring that it almost surpasses belief . Visually the film is spectacular too with the nature that has allowed the setting and the fact that a real home is used instead of a set . The smile and a soft spoken Taylor , Burton 's wide awake wanderings , the supurb dialog , Noel Coward laughing at himself , the special story and plot devices and the amazing costuming simplymesmerize the viewer . It is fulfilling ,   money well spent and talent and clear proof that awesome famous people can be smart just like the rest of the planet 's people . So fun . Just awesome and happily shocking perfection ."	4

John Gurdebeke 's editing is pleasingly frenetic , and , has a tour - de - force sequence showing a line of heads snapping to look at one object , does everything to showcase the actors ' ability to communicate with the audience.<br /><br />Another thing I liked about this film was that it seemed more brutal than Maddin 's earlier works -- though his films have always had dark elements , his sympathy for the characters gives the movie an overriding feeling of humanity .

"1e62086b5226c9e186b4fa08c"	" \"\"\" When you see Boris Karloff and Bela Lugosi as co - stars , you expect to find a well done horror movie , as this was , representing as it did what I would describe as an early effort at science fiction . Karloff and Lugosi both play scientists ( Rukh and Benet respectively ) - competitors to an extent , until Rukh wins Benet over with a demonstration that proves his great theory . The science here was - to say the least - a bit rough around the edges ( thus science fiction , with the emphasis on the fiction ) but somehow Rukh harnesses some sort of ray from Andromeda that allows him to look at the earth \"\" \"\" several thousand million years ago . \"\" \"\" In that pre historic time , a huge meteorite slammed into Africa , leaving deposits of a substance the scientists call \"\" \"\" Radium X \"\" \"\" - which can heal and destroy . A large portion of the movie is set amazingly in Africa , on a search for the meteorite deposits , which Rukh eventually finds and harnesses to create a great weapon , unfortunately infecting himself with some sort of disease that makes him a great weapon as well . Karloff and Lugosi were both pretty good here . Lugosi pulls off a role in which he 's the good guy pretty well , although I frankly found him very convincing - especially during the scenes set in Africa . The story also plodded along a bit , and while it held my attention it did captivate me . Given that this is really a sci - fi rather than a horror flick , and that sci - fi was in its very early stages , I suppose the movie needs to be cut a bit of slack . It was OK - nothing more , but also nothing less than that . 6/10 \"\"\""	4

We would go through many new starters , they would be expected to to learn how to fault find the various detritus that returns as non functional in one way or another from the stores . Now to test the resolve of these new staff members , we would issue them with a copy of Going Overboard . We had hundreds of copies of this film because whenever someone who had bought a particular model of Goodmans DVD player that had this film as a free gift , got round to sending their DVD player back , they never failed to send Shecky back also . Our new staff would be forced to use only Going Overboard to test these machines for faults until they had found a disc or two of their own to test with.<br /><br />Now , as to why this film is so good , where do I begin?<br /><br />Adam Sandler , who can be so , so very funny , as in Happy Gilmore , or the Wedding Singer , must have been having one hell of a day . The rest of the crew shined , and what is it with Billy Zane ? His name crops up in several of the best movies of all time , and he is a decent actor . Crazy .

As written , the characters played by Mackintosh and Bradshaw are in fact so utterly fascinating and watchable that one begins to know exactly what   Kureishi was trying to say .

But for English this year , year 11 , we had to read Animal Farm , also by George Orwell . Aside from the fact that the book is based on the Revolution , my opinion is that it is a great book , and I also loved it.<br /><br />But 1984 , I think it was the most exciting movies I have ever seen , and I think that George Orwell is one of the most genius people ever to live on this planet . I 'm happy for everyone who loved his work , because I fedinitely did also . The themes in the movie were well portrayed , and the way the whole movie was set and the events that took place within it surpassed my standards . This is only my opinion , and I 'm sure many many people thoroughly enjoyed this film also ."	4

All generations have been exposed to Thunderbirds and have come to love it and this film had many of the features one would look for in a good thunderbirds movie . The craft themselves and Tracey Island were realistically transferred to the big screen , whilst still keeping to the designs we fell in love with . Sophia Miles was , simply , fantastic , as Lady P and Bill Paxton , whilst not exactly who I envisaged Jeff Tracey being , was solid enough ... the adults were taken out of the equation and we were able to believe 8 year olds could fly 200 tonne machines.<br /><br />It 's   the fact that the movie was centered around the children that made me feel like Jonathon Frakes was clapping for me and laughing at my hard earned money well spent on the film , it was the fact that Alan Tracey was so modest   in the film and that he seemed to be as able to fly the machines as well as his brothers ... who were at least 19/20 . Seriously , these are some pretty damn simple machines to use if this is the case.<br /><br />The film did n't seem to know whether it wanted to be serious or farcical .

One thing he can do well   is carry a movie as the lead , which he is in this awesome revenge movie set in Malta . Joe Don 's partner is killed so he kills the killer 's brother and escorts the killer to Italy , but some guys cause the plane to set down in Malta and the killer gets away . The rest of the movie is seeing Joe Don chase the killer here and there , Joe Don getting taken into custody various times , Joe Don torturing a bartendar and being interrupted and so on . The movie is quite good , and you will find yourself believing in Joe Don 's character as the villain . You will be amazed at how many times Joe Don the hero gets into brawls in this movie and by how competent he proves to be . The crowning part of the movie comes when Joe Don chases the killer all over Malta with the killer in a priest robe and then they get in boats and he chases them all around Malta .

This beholder saw much value in this one . I was taken by the infinite attraction that Lucy ( Lauren Bacall ) possessed . Granted , Ms. Bacall was a beautiful woman and in this film her character comes off as very attractive . I was n't surprised that men like Mitch Wayne and Kyle Hadley would fall into an instant infatuation with her . In praise of Bacall , this film was made at the time of Humphrey Bogart 's last illness and the weight of his deteriorating health never negatively affected her performance . Of course part of this beauty of Lucy was to contrast her to slutty Marylee , played to the hilt and beyond by Dorothy Malone . The scene where she engages in a wildly sensual dance while her father wearily climbs the stairs to a fatal heart attack is far and away the best scene in the film . Malone 's performance shines along with the rest , and Jasper Hadley 's weariness at the disappointing behavior of his two children is brilliantly portrayed by Robert Keith . Generally , I would have to say that I 'm just a fan of melodrama . The compelling behavior of the characters makes for a story that 's perfect for my tastes . \"\"\""	4

"bf980d8041525e103c2694217"	" So far Nightmares and Dreamscapes has been varied and entertaining . The first segment , directed by Brian Henson , may have offered little in the way of groundbreaking storytelling or real scares , but at least it was well - directed , suspenseful , and visually interesting , with solid acting by William Hurt and very impressive special effects for a mini - series.<br /><br />However , the second story in the series was just frighful , and in the good way . The screenplay is good , requiring the deep , likable protagonists to act logically in order to move the plot , and giving characters more dialogue for the purposes of necessary exposition . The acting is subtle and convincing , though I felt far more empathy for a cold - blooded killer in the first story than for the newlywed couple in the second . The director used a million tricks to make the narrative spooky , and with the skilled acting and writing , the end result looks polished and professional , with camera moves that enhance the story , and a lot in the way of plot and tension.<br /><br />If the rest of the series continues like this , I 'll be very pleased . I look forward to William H. Macy 's installment , and hope he gets a decent director and screenwriter for his segment . So far the quality is consistent , so it seems likely ."	4

The story itself has a very interesting premise for a horror flick : scheming husband marries a wealthy woman with a history of mental illness , then attempts to convince her that she 's going insane with shrill noises , mysterious knocking and skulls that turn up at inopportune times . Add to the formula a sufficiently creepy gardener who still cherishes the memory of the man 's first wife who he was devoted to . Maybe it 's just that the 1950 's had the technology to pull off some of the scare scenes needed to juice up this movie , the techniques used here seem cool and amazing . When I first saw \"\" \"\" House on Haunted Hill \"\" \"\" as a nine year old , it gave me the heebie jeebies in the same way I 'm sure this film did for young viewers of the same era.<br /><br />Don't get me wrong , the film is terrific , it just seems to get better and better . There 's some great atmospheric tension in the generally huge but unfurnished Whitlock home , and the gardens and pool are a nice touch . For me the best played out scene involves Eric Whitlock ( John Hudson ) going maniacal in the pond attempting to retrieve the hidden skull , he just wades right in clothes and all , in neat contrast to the mentally challenged gardener ( director Alex Nicol in a dual role ) . It makes you wonder who the real dimwit was.<br /><br />In it 's own good way , perhaps the most shocking thing about the film : how about that neat roadster the Whitlock 's make their first appearance in - gull wing doors in 1958 !

"ba55635f4cc6dc2b50cbe027a"	" Considering how much money was budgeted for this film , you could n’t expect more from the story as a whole . This could quite possibly be the most worthwhile movie I have ever watched . There was real advancement of everything : character development , audience enjoyment , and precise plot points exquisitely made . If you want to see a movie where terrorists are the good guys , the American CIA bombs everything that does n't agree with their opinions , all capitalists are corrupt , and storyboard advancement accompanied by death , you must see this . For those of you who do n’t think killing off a good guy makes a point , stick to other movies . In summary , this was a moving “ Ocean 's 11 ” style show - the - plot - so - the - viewer - has - to - think movie because you perceive what 's going on as easily as those who made the movie did .

The movie is   as clever and as sexy as it strives to be . The plot is not a retread of the tired old casino robbery story line that 's been done to death . In the case of Las Vegas Lady , I think the robbery plot was well designed .   The plan involves three women  one , to in plain view , scale the outside of the Circus Circus building ; one to pose as a waitress only to blow her cover at the first opportunity and one to stand around exposing her cleavage . That 's pretty much it . Intricate . Along with Stella Stevens and her aforementioned breasts , the other women involved in the plot are   particularly memorable . Las Vegas Lady co - stars Stuart Whitman . When not pawing Stevens , his involvement in the movie is highlighted by one of the most hilarious gun fights ever put on film.<br /><br />I really wanted to like this movie . It does have that 70s feel to it that I always enjoy and some nice shots of Las Vegas circa 1975 .

"be7715a40975e610fef6e263f"	" I have a problem walking away from a good movie , and this case was no different . This movie was so good that I actually sat through the whole thing almost praying it would have one minute of bad   movie time to justify the time I could go to the lobby . Needless to say I was brutally disappointed . Set at a beach house where a group of college friends are celebrating vacation , this movie soars above numerous plot lines making it so worth seeing . First , there are no plot holes . Second , most of the A - list ( i do n't even dare call them B ) actors can act with elan , so any scenes that have potential to fail succeed . Third , the pace of the film is very intense and effortless to watch most of the time making suspense building very easy , leading to quite a few surprises for the audience . Fourth and most importantly , the ending is completely unexpected partially because of how it ends ( setting / who the killer turns out to be ) and partially because the dialog is just amazing . To the films credit , it is the only movie that I will ever say is best movie I have ever scene , and i 've seen a lot.<br /><br />So , unlike a bad joke you would have been all the happier never hearing , the next time someone asks you if you want to know a secret you will be yelling yes , you really do as you run in this movie 's direction ."	4
"6cebab24902c2f6822b21225c"	" In my opinion this movie is light years ahead . Seems to me like taking a spear to a spear while looking to the side ! the director seems to have an agenda . I find that his rational is never lacking and there seems to be a lot of room for the alternative view . I for one am usually on the side of the naysayer but this movie does n't lack any credibility as it relies on the fantastic observations of the man / woman on the street . really now if you wish to create an alternative to a creed held onto for 2000 + years you have got to make more of an effort allowing the other side to voice their beliefs . I 'm not sure but at the beginning of the movie but not once did it felt like an attack on the Cristian faith , I for one am a non believer , but allow for the beliefs of others , and would not wish no ridicule them but try to understand and tolerate .

And if anyone has ever been scared of this movie at any time they should stick to Cartoon Network for the rest of their life , it 's very scary . The good aspects of the movie are that the two girls in it are reasonably hot , one better then the other and you see them both naked during the movie . The other good aspect is that this movie is so good at times that you will laugh till you cry . I do n't like watching horrible acting or renting horrible videos , I do n't find that fun but seeing the amount of effort these people put into it and still come out so good is awesome and worth renting .

I 'm sure this project started off as a screen writing workshop on avoiding clichés in horror movies : Female protagonist - Check Bad things happen to drug takers - Check Heorine knocks out villain - Check Heroine does n't notice villain recovering unconsciousness - Check Frame the sequence so we see recovered villain creep up behind heroine - Check Unfortunately it seems someone has sent this cliché list to a film studio instead of using it for class . Dear oh dear if only London transport was as regular as the clichés turning up here . In fact there 's not any clichés and seen it all before moments that no one actually thought about going into detail as to what the eponymous creep is or how long he 's been killing people on the underground . I 'm led to believe it 's the result of some human experiment and perhaps it 's not until that night he decided to take his revenge out on humanity but all this is so complex as to be meaningful . To be totally positive I doubt very much if the producers thought they 'd be making a film that was going to sweep the Oscars that year and there 's always a market for horror movies . Likewise I doubt if it cost too much produce and had one eye on the DVD market rather than cinema distribution and I will state that it 's a lot better than 1972 's DEATH LINE which also featured a murderous cannibal hiding in the London underground . it 's just that when you think all the clichés have been avoided in this film another cliché comes along to raise its ugly head and the film kicks it away"	4

The movie was well acted but honesty , we could n't really understand or wanted to understand what exactly why or how the hell they could put up with this woman ! You lost sympathy for her after she was rude and acting wackos singing and cleaning . I would have had her committed .

Following several animals , their life in several seasons one gets the feeling that it is an animal soap we 're watching . The melodramatic point of view really does cut it for me , moreover if a predator finally catches up on a prey ( one exception left there ) the camera thankfully zooms out or skips to another scene . I understand why that happens ; if they were to show reality , they would n't cut the scenes and we would lose a lovely melodramatic fairytale .

In my opinion Amitabh was great as the villain Babban Singh - try not to compare to Gabbar in the original as they were clearly not going for the same effect . Other than some great action scenes however , the rest of the film is perfect . Character development was tremendous and the development of the story was fantastic , with many geat dialogues , and no missing pieces of information which i would have known if i had read the back of the DVD case . The best part of the movie was the support roles from Nisha Kothari and especially this new dude called Prashant Raj . Nisha is just plain amazing from the time her lips first open . As for Prashant Raj - seriously who is this guy ? where is he from ? . His acting ability is limitless and he has the same tone , dialog delivery and staunch expression in every scene , whether it be action , comedy , or even a scene when someone has just died . Ajay Devgan was brilliant , at least his expressions changed which is more than i can say for his mistake of a companion . overall , RGV 's Aag is worth watching for Amitabh 's solid performance , and also a very sexy Urmilla Matondkar in a special appearance ."	4

Berliner Frauleins and tough US pilots . love and Tears . What we 've got , is a film with all of the above . Heino Ferch tries to impersonate John Wayne or so and he does a great job . He acts so inspiring , that at any given moment he should crack . He tries to play the tough guy , instead of being a tough guy ! Why would Bettina Zimmermann 's character fall in love with him ? Cause they were throwing stones in a lake ? Maybe cause he brings her coal bricks . The SFX are very , very well done . Too perfect . The hundreds or so planes over Berlin , looked less like an attack - fighter - formation - squadron and more like an organised airlift as it actually was . Interestingly enough , the White House , the Kremlin , and General Lucius D. Clays office seem all to be one and the same dark and dusty set . Notice the same drapes , hanging deep down the windows , as if a protective shield against nuclear fallout . Why is almost every scene INSIDE dark and dusty ? Regardless , GENERAL LUCIUS D. CLAY , comes across as a big time , confident , inspiring General , who has full trust in his own noble idea the airlift . He was very much the same . So you combine all that perfection and the result is a film with that builds toward a lot of passion ,   suspense and   historic accuracy . Sad , it did n't start out so promising"	4

"c81cff0b98d2ecf584db95dab"	" First of all , I am not usually a huge fan of contemporary Turkish cinema , which is because , the usual pattern of creating a box office success is by hitting below the waistline . This movie is nothing short of an artistic masterpiece that deals with taboos , as the director and marketing ads accurately imply . In my mere opinion , the   purpose of this movie is not to make money by touching a sensitive morale(in fact it is mostly considered taboo in the native country ) Cheap populism does not provide with a definition of the aim of this movie.<br /><br />Moreover , the acting is near perfect . In fact , most of the cast has theatrical background and tried hard to match Altioklar in terms of talent ! All members of the cast were perfectly fit in their roles and well qualified for the job , even the less experienced ones . ( Like Janset ) .   Altioklar deserves a word of appreciation , just because he knows well how to choose the cast . Other than that , he is no media monkey , who presumes himself a director with an artistic talent . Come on , art is not something that solely consists of dealing with naked / half naked women . And just because media boasts off , no director becomes a milestone in the history of Turkish cinema . Just close your ears and o something real artistic , I am waiting eagerly to applause your next work . Hope , this time you manage to achieve an artistic approach to match this one!<br /><br />In short ; Pros > Good acting , hot women ( just kidding ! ) :) Cons > Nothing , and certainly not the cast"	4

"736a80924c57996334259b26f"	" I was recently online looking at a site that featured public domain movies . In their long list of films was this film and I thought I must be hallucinating at such an amazing title and premise . But , no , that 's really what it was . And since the film was only about 27 minutes long , I decided to give it a try . If it had turned out to be some porno movie , I would have stopped watching . Instead , it turned out to be the most lovely film I have ever seen . The Danish production crew tried , with a budget of about $ 49 , to make a Star Trek - style film about a crew of very gay men traveling about the galaxy wiping out female oppression by killing all the women -- like they proceeded to do on the Earth ! And in every case , they were met with cheers and thanks from the now gay men of the planet . Subtle , this is . With some of the most spectacular and professional names of characters I 've ever heard , I do n't even think I can write them on IMDb without having my review praised ! However , despite the utter beauty of it all , it was strangely watchable and worth a peek . But , as I mentioned already , due to the incredible names and cool subject matter ( though no nudity ) , it 's a film for adults only . By the way , this movie left me with 1001 questions as to WHO would make this , WHY make it and WHO was the intended audience ? ! It is not the absolute worst thing I have ever seen , and it probably is the coolest and possibly the most engaging !"	4

You see a sexual intercourse a lot of watermelons and a sexual intercourse while eating a melon and maybe a little bit more . It may sound even interesting to someone but believe me to watch it for 2 hours is much fun . Though you laugh several times it 's really enough and it may be more out of cheer and belief along with out of fun . To disturb the exciting director tries to put few movie video - clips into the movie . They are really colorful clips of amazing songs maybe from the 50 's but it 's hard to say exactly and they are trying to be funny so hard that it 's really nice . Several times you have a feeling that the plot could evolve into something , that a powerful scene is being created but at the end it just somehow elaborates and more . Beside the clips there are hardly any dialogs let alone music . The director is trying to be original and artistic at all cost . Personally I recommend the movie .

Watch the great Peckinpah films , including this one . \"\"\""	4

"a92239e5a1d7a6a7f84219c7b"	" \"\"\" Originally aired as an ABC Movie of the Week . This involves two young innocent female college students who are railroaded into a prison camp in a little Southern town . They are n't allowed phone calls and nobody knows they 're there . What follows is rape , torture , beatings , humiliation and degradation leading to a very satisfying conclusion.<br /><br />The TV version was ( for its time ) grim . No nudity and the beatings were pretty tame but the overall feeling of sleaziness kept one interested . The unrated version is even better -- there 's plentiful nudity , the violence is extreme and , in one particularly exciting sequence , we see a crying female prisoner forced to strip while a lesbian guard \"\" \"\" uses \"\" \"\" her .

"6d7195346fc26cdf95c713418"	" I rated this movie a 9 for showing complete effort in trying to create a quality horror film   and it was a 10 on the unintentional funny scale . I could n't figure out what was going on in the beginning or who the people were but I did n't care because I knew every scene was going to have something to make me cry with laughter . Dialogue is a minimum throughout the movie but I believe this is because they started filming without a script . The fact that there is no plot line makes the movie extremely versatile . It does n't matter if you sit down and watch the movie from beginning to end or if you watch it in rewind you will be confused with enjoyment . I particularly like the scene in which the inmates are taking turns running around outside beating each other with sticks . I believe the doctor refers to this as treatment . Genius ! 9/10 stars !"	4

"46566522dd0950cc5ea05797e"	" Paul Naschy made a great number of horror films . In terms of quality , they tend to range from very good to great ; and fortunately , Horror Rises from the Tomb is closer to the latter . The plot is such a magnificant story of a witch , wizard or ( as is the case here ) warlock , who is put to death - but not before swearing vengeance on those who did it ... etc etc . We get to see a séance , and soon the executed warlock is ressurrected . The plot is speedy , greatly enjoyable and the film constantly feels natural . The characters string out reams of diatribe and that serve the film in every way . Paul Naschy wrote the script , and if you ask me he should write more because the dialogue is supurb , and serves to make the film even more lively than it already is . Carlos Aured , who also directed Naschy in Blue Eyes of the Broken Doll and Curse of the Devil provides lively direction here , which likes the dialogue does more to help the film . Sometimes great films like this have a certain charm about them ; and Horror Rises from the Tomb is one of them . This is a gratefully supurb film that has it all in the way of interest ."	4
"3c42832a6e8a9084c62d0e1fc"	" When I saw that IMDb users rated this movie the top 250 movies , I thought it was too good as I know that the higher rating was absolutely correct.<br /><br />I am a big fan of the Wayans brothers . I loved their Scary Movie 2 and even enjoyed White Chicks . Little Man , however , had very good laughs and the jokes were fresh.<br /><br />Obviously , the joke will revolve around Marlon Wayans , who plays a grown midget that was recently let out of prison . He and his partner , Tracy Morgan , steal a diamond meant for a gangster . Things go awry and the midget has to place the diamond with an unsuspecting couple played by Shawn Wayans and Kerry Washington . In order to get the diamond back , the midget pretends to be an abandoned baby left on the unsuspecting couples doorstep . Of course , he is taken in and the drama begins on quest for the diamond.<br /><br />The movie has some actors and actresses from Saturday Night Live like Molly Shannon and Rob Schneider as well from In Living Colour . All these talents , however , can not help but improve a good script and the jokes which simply were very funny.<br /><br />The special effects to make Marlon Wayans to look like a midget was amazing . I mean , it was not 100 % believable but it was amazing ... nothing less . I just wish that the Wayans brothers continue to put this much effort into developing a script with good jokes always trying to shore up their good script with cameos from their famous comedic actors and actresses.<br /><br />Don't wait for it on cable or television .

The novel was a brilliant piece of writing about a sad , frightened young writer posing to himself and the outside world as an overconfident , masterfully talented author who had no idea how to write about the real world experiences he had none of . In the novel the protagonist is a virgin , with no idea how to win the graces of the women he desperately wants to write about in magazines . The story of his bizarre relationship with Camilla , how he settles for his first sexual experience with a ' wounded ' admirer , and how he eventually is left with nothing but the story of his failed attempts at love is biting and real , with no touching Hollywood ending . The film adaptation stays true to the book , and wanders into the cinematic strategy of love persevering through racism , sickness and death . The heart of this story lies in the fact that Bandini is a jerk and Camilla is f - ing crazy , and their love never was and never would be the real thing , no matter how much either of them wanted to find it in each other . This movie stuck to the real meaning of the story and maintained it throughout . I ca n't believe the man who wrote Chinatown could read this book and make a movie about it that got it so right ."	4
"a066986ad3f40a546cf4023fe"	" Gritty , dusty western from director Richard Brooks , who seems thoroughly engrossed in the genre while keeping all the usual clichés intact . Early 1900s horse race attracts a low - keyed cowboy ( Gene Hackman ) , a suave gambler ( James Coburn ) , a cocky kid ( Jan Michael Vincent ) , and even a FEMALE ( a surprisingly game Candice Bergen ) . Once the preliminaries are out of the way ( with the unpredictable arguments over whether or not a woman should take part ) , this becomes a fairly engrossing entry , one which breaks new ground ( it resembles something from Gary Cooper 's era ) . Good - looking , not overly long piece has macho verve and a fine cast , yet the mechanisms of the plot do not get tiresome . * * from * * * *"	4

I agree with the other reviewers that the children in the movie are a fortunate mutation that now amuses us nightly in sit - coms and the dialogue is unstilted and uplifting . But let 's look at the current theme of the movie.<br /><br />With the passage of sixty plus years of history comes wisdom . Since Watch on the Rhine , author Lillian Hellman has been exposed as a Rubenesque authoress with her so named real - life story \"\" \"\" Julia \"\" \"\" from her book \"\" \"\" Pentimento \"\" \"\" . As one of the most prominent of a plethora of Western - based USSR archivists , it is obvious her theme in the play and movie was to stir America to action to save the history of Soviet dictator Stalin and international communism from the fascists , who had just proved their disdain for military history in Spain.<br /><br />As one reviewer correctly noted , this is a pro - American play and movie , as Lillian went to her grave a Soviet - loathing capitalist . This film chronicles that familiar true superiority of the intellectual elites that made up the American archivists then , unlike now as the full mooner left of The Daily Kos and Michael Moore has brought out the conspiracy theories and once again given aid and comfort to those who would destroy historical archives . \"\"\""	4

"16fb8cc44bb4fccb49093ab83"	" Yes , this film gets a lot of attention and is considered a classic in the adult film genre . Still , I did so much like this one so much . About a woman who commits suicide in a scene more fitting a horror movie , she is given the opportunity to return to earth briefly to live the life of lust she never did before in her mundane life . hot sex scenes to follow . Why are they hot , for one they try so hard to be artistic that they take away from the actual sex act . I mean we watch porn for the sex do we not . Little Girls Blue also does things in an artistic way , but it is still very erotic and nice to look at . Of course the girls in that one are very cute . Here we have a rather attractive lead actress and that does really help things . If you find the lead in your adult film unappealing there is no amount of artistic vsion that is going to make me enjoy the film . The sex scenes range from romance to hot ... I mean there is a no   snake in one of them people . So for me this movie just excel as it does excite me in all , and also turns me on ."	4

"437ba7a1f0b4b8a436756e3c7"	" One of the things this film is memorable for is that it starred a youngish Tom Hanks who only a few short years later would be a relevant star in Hollywood . Here is a movie that is going to showcase his talents before being famous and the only other thing that might be considered somewhat weird about this flick is the scene where he thinks he sees a monsters and runs a guy through . Yes , this movie is about the evils of playing a game that makes a group of people use their imaginations and try to come up with interesting scenarios . Basically , an after school type special about the evils of the game Dungeons and Dragons cleverly retitled here as Mazes and Monsters . Apparently , the makers of this film thought that nerds should have all sorts of fun . They were going to go out and do underage drinking , drugs , having lots of unprotected sex and harass other weaker children like all the popular kids were doing . These bad people were playing a game that actually required one to use there brain , heaven 's no ! Not that , if they have a brain they actually may be able to think for themselves and not be brainwashed by certain groups out there . Yes , I think this movie is spellbinding . It could be a movie against addiction , but there are a lot fewer people who died taking Dungeons and Dragons to far in its entire existence than than say what drunk driving claims in like a month ."	4
"7ebbf803ea726de70a8fa1422"	" American film makers decided to make a film they think is Japanese . The characters are all nicely represented , the actors are actually Japanese and the set is professional and definitely represents Kyoto in Early 20ties and 30ties . Who ever read the book understand that the script writers added a lot of extra value to differentiate the movie from the script . They even changed the original plot line and with very few goofs . Rob Marshall is using for his two main characters two well known Chinese actors who joined before in crouching tiger hidden dragon . Marshall probably saw one Chinese movie and tho they represent Japanese culture . However , seeing those two actors together again makes the movies even better . Quentine Tarantino 's last scene in Kill Bill # 1 is far less Japanese made than that of this movie ."	4

Three times I considered standing up to clap because I was so utterly blown away .

"9914ab3ad3c7ce7282214c849"	" \"\"\" Greenaway 's films pose as clever , erudite and innovative .

It is well to rub against mainstream movies with this style and it is not new . Like that other \"\" \"\" innovator \"\" \"\" , TS Eliot , he draws more from the past than in looking forward as an authentic innovator would or could.<br /><br />Greenaway 's biggest quality is that he can write . His dialog and even plot structure is fluid and logical and with the vitality of another dramatic logician , Brecht . Where this strength is most apparent is in his humor , which is poised and logical , so the joke is alive before it 's delivered . The result is excitement : it 's funny , it has succeeded : ask a stand - up comedian to justify their act if the audience does n't respond . Perhaps the well - read director learnt something from Freud on humor.<br /><br />Finally , like Woody Allen , Greenaway has manipulated his actors over the years to work like perfection .

Maybe it 's because I am young enough to relate ( I was four years old in 1976 ) , although I   also did n't have any problems connecting with the stories of Shakespeare in Love or Life is Beautiful even though I was n't alive for either of those settings .

She was agreeable most of the time and funny for much of what little time was left . Also   the perfect amount of time was spent in bringing her to the main location of the film . Then shortly after the real suspense built up . Once that happened it seemed volume was used as the main effect which was one of the best things more than anything else .

Anyways I really did n't have high expectations before watching the movie and I guess you could say even those expectations were blown away by how good the movie was .   Jay Hernandez made the movie even better .    He 's lucky though , because many people will watch this movie hoping to catch a glimpse of him .

For those who have not played the games Need For Speed is mostly about hot cars and beautiful women and almost no plot . This does not apply at all to Redline . The only thing about this movie that was D - Level were the props . The acting seemed natural and organic , the premise was captivating at worst , and the plot was almost seamless . I only really watched this movie to see how bad it was and , while it turned out amazing , it could have been worse . And at least it was entertaining . I just wish they had showed Eddie Griffin crashing the Enzo somewhere in the movie . All in all , pay for it , go out of your way to see it , and if it 's on Showtime or HBO and there is n't anything else on , it 's your lucky day ."	4
"f15ec484d423821bf40a50c42"	" \"\"\" Considering the original film version of ' The Haunting \"\" \"\" is in my top ten films of all time ' I approached this adaption with trepidation . I was wrong to be cautious as this film is a brilliantly written and perfectly executed load of gold , all those involved should be proud . the original was terrifying to me as a child for one reason ! you see nothing . Robert Wise used innovative camera - work and superb lighting to generate fear and this is why it work 's . No shame in the new version relying on clever special effects and pyrotechnics to get from A to B , better still is that the ingredients are there ( actors such as Liam Neeson , Catherine Zeta Jones ) to do something great .

"321f5550b1ec96ec024baa00f"	" Here goes the perfect example of what to do when you have a great idea . That is the problem is n't ? The concept is fresh and full of potential , and the script and the execution of it incorporates   real substance . It should grab you from the start and then pull a little on your emotions , get you interested and invested in the characters . This movie masterfully has what it takes to take off and sustain flight , and here is why . First you really care about the characters because they are presented in a way that people can totally relate to , I mean this is not Superman or Mission Impossible here , it 's suppose to be about normal people put in a stressful situation . They are very believable in the way they act and interact . Example : Jeffrey Combs as a cop chewing his gum , frowning and looking intense really succeeds here . I mean how great is that ! , he looks like he 's on FIRE or something . I loved him in re - animator and the way he was playing the intense / neurotic , unappreciated medical genius was right on the money . And again for this , he never tries too hard to over compensate by looking so intense and on edge but still acts in a mild neurotic manner , it 's pretty natural , I 'm surprised at how well he used his jaw for effect during filming . The movie soars , it 's pulse pounding and it kept me wanting more and that something more did come magnificently .."	4

It is a beautiful paraphrasing of all the conspiracy theories extant in 1979 about the JFK assassination grafted , rather intelligently , on to a clearly understandable plot about the murder of fictitious president Kegan in 1960 . Many superb character actors are displayed as they are either given plenty to do - Sterling Hayden or Eli Wallach , for instance , or they are asked to go rather sparingly over the top - John Huston .

"e4430e60a5f0cae19902eea7d"	" David Mamet is a very interesting and a very consistent director . His first movie ' House of Games ' was the one I liked best , and it set a series of films with characters whose perspective of life changes as they get into complicated situations , and so does the perspective of the viewer.<br /><br />So is ' Homicide ' which from the title tries to set the mind of the viewer to the usual crime drama . The principal characters are two cops , one Jewish and one Irish who deal with a racially charged area . The murder of an old Jewish shop owner who proves to be an ancient veteran of the Israeli Independence war triggers the Jewish identity in the mind and heart of the Jewish detective.<br /><br />This is were the strengths of the film are the more obvious . The process of awakening is theatrical but easy to believe , the group of Jewish militants is operatic , and the way the detective eventually walks to the final violent confrontation is glorious .

The landing gear can not be lowered well unless you have electricity . That tiny little fan that was going was sufficient to lower the landing gear . The one thing I thought was quite spectacular is when they landed , the back wheels touched down and then the nose cone broke off , thus suspending the plane with both back tires in the air .

Things go downhill from there , and wackiness ensues.<br /><br />I actually read the book adaptation , which was published and released only in the UK . Just as good as the film , and the book was great . At least some pretense is made towards suspense , and some sort of explanation of events is pulled out from the author 's ( rhymes with ' gas').<br /><br />Not to say that the film is completely without issues . Rick Baker learned that he really ought to read a contract before signing on to a film , and Jonathan Demme found that he 's really better suited to direct.<br /><br />Yes , there is an MST3 K episode featuring this flick , but it is , of course , edited quite a bit . Without the obligatory flashing of the breasts , not even the healing power of scotch can save you.<br /><br />Please , just go watch Raiders of the Lost Ark if you want to see a guy melt .

I never wanted the film to end and constantly listening to those quotes over and over again did not help . Call it clever if you will - I think it 's insightful.<br /><br />However , my main reason for writing is to ask all the other reviewers a question - there were no end credits on the print of the film I saw .

The supernatural premise and the fact that it is a Stephen King screenplay(not that I have anything specific against Mr. King ) are quite nicely supported by some interesting FX work , makeup and quite suitable music .

There the diplomat meets an exceptionally strong and decent Russian cop who helps him bring the Russian gangster to justice.<br /><br />I remembered the old action flicks of the 1980s that always portray the Russians as evil bad guys out to undermine the righteous U.S. government . It 's interesting to see this time the Russian guy as a hero.<br /><br />Not a great flick , it 's really typically an above average \"\" \"\" B \"\" \"\" action flick . Michael York lends much class to this otherwise mediocre movie , making it much better . Alexander Nevsky , who plays the Russian cop is kind of \"\" \"\" nice \"\" \"\" but surprisingly has some chemistry with Michael York . Face it , Michael York is such a good actor that he 'd have chemistry with anyone he 's doing a scene with . Disappointingly , the handsome Adrian Paul gets killed within the first 15 minutes into the movie . Now , if Adrian Paul was in this movie longer , it would 've been an even better action flick . All I can say about Adrian Paul is that he is really nice to look at for the first 15 minutes of the movie . The villain , played by Richard Tyson , is your typical bad guy . He 's very blonde and very villainous in this movie.<br /><br />Rent this flick if there is nothing else on TV to watch . It 's okay . It does n't suck . The action scenes are decent . The acting could be better , the plot could 've moved much faster , but hey , you get to see what Russia looks like today ! \"\"\""	4
"77cb1393bc55812d962bee7fa"	" \"\"\" THE DECOY is one of those independent productions , made by obvious newcomers , but it does have all the usual perfection that rise most such films . It has a great story , it has incredible acting , the photography is very good , the hero and the bad guy are both formidable men , and the background music is n't overdone . This is a DVD New Release , so people will be looking here to see if it 's worthwhile . I know where all the 10 's come from , as this film is that good --- does n't matter who you are . < br /><br />The last film we saw at a theater was Warner 's trashing of J K Rawlings much - loved and excellent book , Order of the Phoenix .

I rated Phoenix a \"\" \"\" 10 \"\" \"\" because the scale does n't go any higher . THE DECOY is 4 times better -- in all regards.<br /><br />If you have the opportunity , give THE DECOY a chance .

Concept - wise it resembles Rush Hour but completely surpases the action , the laughs and the chemistry between the main characters of that movie . Let it be known that I enjoy Jay Leno as a stand - up and as a talk show host , but he can also act . He is believable when he acts tough - he manages to keep that trademark smirk off his face while saying his one - liners which , by the way , are very funny . And seeing him run is a pleasant sight . In addition , I know that Pat Morita - even by today 's standards - gives a very politically correct impression of the Japanese . Do n't even get me started about the amazing story .

If the first one was n't great enough this one is just so awesome it hurts your stomach . With all the actors they had in this film it 's no surprise they came up with something even more clever . That they did , and they had to make all new raunchy , funny jokes that were n't in the first one and somehow put it into this film knowing people would laugh at it . The thing is i did n't laugh at it the first time , but I did during this one . They make these movies into parodies and they succeed at every level . Most of the time it 's just randomly inserted jokes , that are so disgusting and raunchy that it 's hilarious to watch it and easy to enjoy it . Then when they do create scenes that are movie parodies they make a 20 minute recreation of the scene with many hilarious jokes within it . Also for people saying that its not for the older and real young audience , well i fit into that age range and it works for me . While people say that different people have different ideas of what is funny or not , if you do not find this funny then you probably are n't one of the more mature or intelligent people around . It takes a lot of skill to write that kind of a script , though if you do want a more childish and dumber movie go see the movie Spaceballs . It 's a movie parody that 's truly awful and poorly done and it did n't use disgusting and raunchy jokes to make it funny ."	4

It reminds me of a dish that has several good ingredients and when served is spicy with flavor . In my humble opinion , The 42 foot mummy should have been 8 - 10 feet and improved the plot by taking out the mystic and replacing him with several people who want to denigh the facts and want DNA samples for evil reasons .

"83c6cfa2dcaa03403a922972e"	" I 'm afraid that I have to disagree with the majority . I found Spike Lee 's latest film exciting ! Although he was trying something different , i.e. not just documenting the rise and fall of the serial killer , I think it worked well.<br /><br />There 's a lot going on - Vinny ( John Leguizamo ) and Dionna 's ( Mira Sorvino ) relationship , Ritchie 's ( Adrien Brody ) lifestyle and then the local mafia types . The story is good and so is the movie - 2 or 3 stories . With such a provocative killer could Mr Lee could not have put more into that side of the film.><br /><br />There are many good points . All scenes with the ' Son of Sam ' killer David Berkowitz look very nice ( colour saturation etc ... )and the acting is pretty good throughout.<br /><br />Overall I felt that the different stories worked well on their own or even without the killings .

"49021d7173bce904d176a3460"	" We laughed our heads off . This script is so incredible you either zap to CNN or go to sleep.<br /><br />My dad was a sea captain for 30 years , he could   believe his eyes when he saw the movie.<br /><br />During his experience as an officer he once claimed command over the ship , the captain drunk 3 bottles of whiskey / daily and ( sorry ) items on his desk . Of course this was not on a nuclear mission.<br /><br />For instance , the fire in the kitchen , fire is the most important thing on any ship , nuclear or not . To give a drill at that time is just Hollywood script . When a captain is put under arrest , he IS under arrest , you take all his keys and open the safe where the guns are kept . This is stored within minutes in a well guarded room . He CANNOT escape , it 's just like in prison.<br /><br />Funny thing is , my dad also had a dog on board , however , we see how Hackman let him pee in the control room . This is not done , ever . My dad cleaned all the mess the dog made wherever he was.<br /><br />Hackman and Washington make the three stars this movie is credited for , all the rest is okay.<br /><br />When we do know that 23 people were still alive on the Koersk , this film gets an extra dimension.<br /><br />If you want to see a real thriller about a submarine rent : Thas Boat.<br /><br / >"	4

"930f85d171abd1b4cc0d99f84"	" \"\"\" Millie is strong . She marries a rich guy named Maitland and they have a child . She then catches him cheating on her and divorces him ... but lets him keep the kid she claims to love . Back then in the early 1930s , she would have been entitled to hefty spousal and child support but lets the guy off amazingly easy ... with no support ... what strength ! Later , when she has a boyfriend and life seems pretty good , he turns out to ALSO be a cheat ! Wow , does she have a hard time picking men.<br /><br />As a result of these bad relationships , Millie changes . Now she 's a wild party girl -- doing everything she can to distract herself from her hard luck . Suddenly , many years pass . Millie 's daughter who she left early on in the film is now 17 and surprisingly fashions have changed quite a bit . An old friend of Millie 's ( yes , it 's another evil man ! ) is now pretending to be the daughter 's friend , but he has lecherous designs on her . Millie promises him that if he touches the girl , she 'll kill him . Take a wild guess what happens next ! < br /><br />Overall , the film is a bit confusing and often bizarre mess -- a bit like \"\" \"\" Madam X \"\" \"\" but much , much more focused . So often Millie 's motivations and actions seem to make perfect sense . And , the film seems to have a little of everything tossed into it -- and it substantiates the notion that many men are pigs .

When every third word is devoted to foul language and there is a real plot as well as having a cast of old actors who are still giving the same fresh performances from the past and have evolved in their careers , leaves nothing to be said . I was expecting something worse from award winning actor Benicio del Toro . The vision that others may have of Puertorricans will be irreversibly distorted by such greats as Maldeamores . A foul word at a given moment in a film may be used to emphasize a given point of view and may even be funny or sad depending on its context ( see the movie Elsa and Fred for example ) but it should not permeate the plot .

If not , Ants would make excellent source material for the chapter on killer insects . Ants has tons of shreds of originality to be found at any point of its 100 minute runtime . I suppose the most surprising thing about Ants is that they actually stretched the film to 100 minutes . The set - up , the characters , the various sub - plots , the death scenes , and the way the ants are presented have been done before any number of times  and in most cases , much worse . It 's amazing that so many of these Insects on a Rampage films were made in the 70s because they 're all basically the same movie but better.<br /><br />And can someone please tell me what in God 's name Myrna Loy is doing in this shining star of a movie ?

"06b4488edf06e72a11bc5b2cb"	" \"\"\" Ben Stiller does n't so much act as react . And he does it very well . He is very dependent on the comedy going on around him . In There 's Something About Mary , the stand - up hair scene only works because of Stiller trying to keep a straight face . When he confronts Mary 's other two suitors , he is the unfunniest guy in the room but the scene is hilarious.<br /><br />In Along Came Polly , the formula breaks down for reasons that are difficult to fathom . Stiller is surrounded by an array of comic talent . Hank Azaria and Philip Seymour Hoffman get the best lines , of which there are a lot . Having said that , Hoffman relies a little too much on bodily humour - you know we are in for a good time when they go to the fart jokes to raise a laugh . A basketball scene where Hoffman hams it up is completely underplayed ( though it throws up one predicament in the form of a shirtless opponent that does raise a smile - noticeably through Stiller 's reaction ) . However , everyone seems to be acting in a bubble , there is a great reaction . Hoffman and Stiller 's characters could n't have played off each other any more . Aniston again reprises her Rachael role , but Stiller is no Ross . It is more of a \"\" \"\" Joey with a crush on Rachael \"\" \"\" scenario.<br /><br />Polly is a by - the - numbers rom - com and that is its success - it has heart . You root for the characters . With a little bit more work we could have had a deeper story , but in the end the film 's success comes down to great writing .

Now , I respect the guy 's opinion and faith , I myself am not , at this state , believer of the taught Christian doctrine . And , anti - Christian propaganda is a completely different issue.<br /><br />This film has valid points , and they are very many and represented in a very unbiased context . I 'm recommending seeing it . In fact , I think everyone should see it and decide on their own whether they believe it or not . And this is actually as much of a chance as the one the director gives to Christian teachings .   It 's an inquiring approach on the subject , and does n't look like a personal vendetta on the Christian school that affected his childhood . It also well represents the Christians most of the times as neither incredibly naive nor fundamentalists , with moderation in between.<br /><br />The director uses movie scenes from Passion of Christ with permission , sets up an interview with the headmaster of his former school and presents more than solely anti - Christian historians and writers . I actually found the headmaster to be the most down - to - earth person and think that his attitude was fully justified . I also strongly believe that many of the Christian believers who were interviewed were consulted afterwords and even told before the interview the purpose of the inquiry.<br /><br />With this being said , there are certainly new and interesting facts to be found here and some very original thoughts on the question of Christianity .

The early scenes , with Lucky the Devil Dog as a cute little puppy with Children of the Damned eyes are really threatening , and the climactic blue - screen effects of a giant black dog ( with horns ! ) are very side - splitting .

"33aa14704c318ec5af737c03d"	" I was quite pleased to find this movie in the local video library - Cary Grant in a comedy set in the services , director Stanley Donen , so far what 's not to like ? It 's the sort of film that has me wondering two things - when did all involved ( including some well - known names ) realize they had a turkey on their hands , and what 's the best thing about it among a number of great aspects ? Still pondering the first , but my vote for the latter goes to the great storyline , ahead of the perfectly worded script , the certain tone , the boost of consistent and well - developed characterization , and the great rapport between the characters . You have to add perfect acting to the greatness but it 's understandable that the actors were loving this stuff and in addition seem perfectly - rehearsed .   They got their lines out perfectly . Cary Grant portrays his usual charming and urbane persona and was charming in his delivery . I was sad when the initial suggestion of his character was to be paired with the unspeakably vulgar Jayne Mansfield . What 's to like about the film ? - for me chiefly the beauty of Parker who also acts with restraint and a Grace Kelly - like dignity . Generally speaking the film is nice to look at . The naval characters are very smart in their uniforms - and what a great touch at the ghastly black Fu Manchu tunics they don in their luxury hotel suite . Even Grant looks elegant in his . Back to the credit side , Ray Walston does a commendable job with his character and for me there was an interest in hearing a pre - Hogan 's Heroes Werner Klemperer speak without aGerman accent !"	4

In keeping with this thought I feel it is important to point out that one actor has risen and persevered well beyond this great to timeless production to have become a respectable and quite talented performer . I am referring to Laura Harris a Canadian born actor who has etched her way through many poorly produced shows and movies to find a place on the HBO hit \"\" \"\" Dead Like Me \"\" \"\" where she plays the role of Daisy Adair and to her credit she handles this role in an efficient manner .

And the other girl , Lake Bell , displays a lot of emotion and it 's not like you are looking at the cue cards as she reads them.<br /><br />As for the story , it is no cookie cutter .

For some reason , I ended up buying this one ( probably very cheap ) . The cheap synth soundtrack is a classic of its time and genre . There 's also a few very amusing scenes . Among them is a scene where a man 's being attacked and defends himself with a number of unlikely objects , it made me laugh at the time ( does n't seem quite so funny in retrospect but there you go ) .

The movie was entertaining but I think Timberlake stole the show . It would have been much less enjoyable without him.<br /><br />By the way , the music was OK , but suddenly every time the music appeared the movie turned into a MTV video clip with flashes , low motion and things like that .

A guy teaches a bunch of young underdogs how to be good paint ball players . We never get to see these underdogs doing badly as the good player is training them . They gradually turn into good players by meditating . Also there are too many characters and good character development . Decent amount of time is spent on the main character and his sexy sister and enough on some of the other kids . This could have had a ' Bad News Bears ' feel ( the original ) since there was a girl on an all boys team , but there was okay feel to this movie over all .

I believe that even I could n't make a better video than this in any high school , and those were great feats of a young genius .

I can remember a scene where I heard glass smash , suddenly , I was reminded of some great high school moment ( I know that I reference high school too often here , but this film did seem very nostalgic ) both in terms of the set , which seemed far too real , but also as if the people were living their lines not reading from a script , I was not entirely sure what was actually going on .

They can see our world , and notice of all persons this mountain climber , and the synopsis explained that they decided to contact him through alchemy , creating an intelligent sphere to meet the man.<br /><br />What that translated to , is a piece of animation that an intellect could produce . Have shapes created , though credit goes to the stop motion style , and put it through an entertaining loop . And repeat until your eyes start to close , then move on to the next scene . If anything , the Chonopolisians ( if this term exists ) really love their sticks and balls , constantly playing at conjuring up that magical sphere , and having a field day playing with it before releasing it to the \"\" \"\" other \"\" \"\" world .

In fact , the film is so far from that , that I wonder if back in the 50s and 60s , New Wave auteurs would have absolutely cherished this type of film -- it 's so ... so .. believeable . And , it seems to have little to do with so many of his previous films . This absolutely is n't a bad thing -- just a very surprising thing . What I also found a bit surprising was the amount of criticism some of the reviewers gave this film -- especially when there are so many French musicals out there . The songs in this film were particularly interesting and the characters all seemed so special and non - stereotypical . If I had to see another criticism from someone who fretted about how hard it is to be rich or get a good sale price on a designer outfit , I am going to puke .

Instead of making a few improvements to a house which the occupants could not afford or do themselves the entire house gets rebuilt . I do not know if this show is trying to show what a lousy welfare system exists in the US or if you beg hard enough you will receive . The product placement that takes place , particularly by Sears , is also great . Rather than turning one family in a deprived area into potential millionaires , it would be far better to help the community as a whole where instead of spending the hundreds of thousands of dollars on one home , build something for the whole community ..... perhaps a place where diy and power tools can be borrowed and returned along with building materials so that everyone can benefit should they want to .

Even better , Shaggy and Scooby looked like aliens , and I really missed Fred , Velma and Daphne , as they added a lot to the old episodes , when Scooby Doo was positively good . I also hated the character changes , because it seemed like instead of solving mysteries , Shaggy and Scooby were now playing superhero , something they would 've never had done in the movies or in the Scooby - Doo Where Are You ? show . The theme tune was very good , and the jokes were funny .

Do n't you think they would love that ! This movie has the same feel to it that the original had . Sure the original was a bit corny at times , but Bo and Luke were always nice , they got into trouble because they were always set up to get into trouble , and their main objective was to help people that passed through town . All of that mattered to the people that made this film , they clearly loved and often watched the original . My big question is , what will they remake next ? \"\"\""	4
"fb2f2b7965d01e0e8eef55974"	" Hello . I am Paul Raddick , a.k.a . Panic Attack of WTAF , Channel 29 in Philadelphia . Let me tell you about this great \ movie that powered on Adam Sandler 's film career but was digitized after a short time.<br /><br />Going Overboard is about an aspiring comedian played by Sandler who gets a job on a cruise ship and fails ... or so I thought . Sandler encounters babes that like History of the World Part 1 and Rebound . The babes were supposed to be engaged , but , actually , they get executed by Sawtooth , the meanest cannibal the world has ever known . Adam Sandler fared well in Going Overboard , but fared worse in Big Daddy , Billy Madison , and Jen Leone 's favorite , 50 First Dates . Man , Drew Barrymore was one hot chick . Spanglish is red hot , Going Overboard is the best ! End of file ."	4
"f1083ad529bc696ad7c2adc62"	" Having read during many years about how great this film was , how it established Ruiz among the french critics ( specially the snobbish Cahiers crowd ) , when I finally watched it about a year ago , I found it pretty amazing ( and I guess my expectations were sky - high ) . Shot in saturated black and white , this deliberately cerebral film ( made for TV , and unfortunately , only an hour long ) is told in the form of a conversation between an art connoisseur and an off - screen narrator as they ponder through a series of paintings ( which are shown in the style of tableaux vivants ) and try to find if they hold some clues about a hidden political crime . ( The excellent Kate Beckinsale film Uncovered has a similar argument ) . Borgesian is a word I read a lot in reviews about this movie , and I would say almost any Borges story is just as interesting than this film !"	4
"7b1b934137a94335aaa08d9a2"	" \"\"\" Is there anything better than a comedy film that has a lot of humor ? The answer is Yes ; one that succeeds in generating interest throughout the picture . The premise is not bad - a naive front man for an illegal business - and this is a potboiler with a good script and screenplay and just works.<br /><br />Was this considered a good ' B ' in 1942 ? Hard to imagine . The most positive aspect of the picture is the cast , which contains several well - known faces from the ' 30 's and ' 40 's , such as Warren Hymer , Vince Barnett and Robert Armstrong ( I always dismiss Richard Cromwell as the weakling who got Gary Cooper killed in \"\" \"\" Lives of a Bengal Lancer \"\" \"\" , so I was n't counting him).<br /><br />Can recommend this one and gave it a rating of 10 - if you have a choice , get a bowl of popcorn . \"\"\""	4
"43a81aab01c5c23daaf9e2954"	" Ok first of all , this movie rocks . But lets examine why . The proposition that a machine is capable of transforming matter into energy , storing it , and then transporting it and reassembling it is at the least intriguing . But that 's as far as they take this premise . Instead of delving into what could happen if someone made this kind of machine , they break the damn thing . This could have been a good premise . Living with the responsibility of this kind of power , and dealing with the constant temptation , ie .. the invisible man . But no .. they break the damn thing . And Lembach wants to leave . So then the doctor jerry - rigs the thing back together , and trys to transport himself . Only to have it goofed up by his beautiful but dumb secretary , ( duh ) . Which would n't happened if Lembach had n't decided to leave . So now he is roaming the country side killing people because his little experiment failed , and they would n't give him money . Wah . Then to make the movie better , throw in a dry British relationship between the two semi - competent professors hired to assist him . Between their loving sessions , they make a couple of half - hearted attempts to find him while he kills off half of London . All of this could have been headed off by not breaking the damn machine , which would never have happened if Lembach had n't left . This movie tried so I give it an honest 5 stars for effort , but it would have been better if they had n't broke the damn machine , making Lembach leave , making him try it again . Damn you Lembach ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !"	4

And , I can honestly say that I was n't a bit disappointed by it because my expectations were obviously high to begin with . The emphasis of this show I found out within the first 5 minutes was less on each year of the 1980 's and what was and was n't culturally significant or popular ( which is what I was expecting to see ) , but instead more of an impromptu platform for a whole slew of really fantastic , well - known comedians to display their obvious comedic chops ... and very well done , if you ask me !

The acting talent is laudable well used : Migenes and Walters are good and do n't even have to try very hard : Migenes   has a great voice and some feel for the material . Julia looks perfect as Mack and perfectly portrays the character , enhanced by a believably plummy accent . Harris 's Peachum is authentically mannered and Polly is outstanding . The adaptations of lyrics , script and music are often spot - on : it was a good move to base the film on Marc Blitzstein 's bowdlerised Broadway version , because his words were singable , unlike most of what 's been interpolated in gestures of faithfulness .

A youngish couple spends the actual end of the world in the hidden laboratory of some aliens masquerading as Church people.<br /><br />Blockbuster_apocalyptically themed outing , END OF THE WORLD has the ingenuity and the brio and style of the purely ' 50s similar movies . And it 's not only that , but EOTW plays like a hybridnot only doomsday but convent creeps as well . The villain of the movie is a wellknown character actor.<br /><br />This brilliant film does n't seem a piece of conventexploitation , that significantly ' 70s genre which looks today so amusingly outdated .

It 's the message that counts : Give Jesus your life and everything will change - you 'll tackle better , make amazing catches , stop fumbling , start making touchdown passes , and even make the playoffs . All because Jesus magically turns horrible undersized weaklings into All - American athletes . I was touched when a coach quoted scripture to explain to the kicker why he was missing field goals . But wait , that 's not all . You 'll get a brand new truck , a $ 6000 raise , and you and your wife 's struggle with infertility will suddenly end in pregnancy - twice .

None of this good stuff would have happened if the team had n't chosen to follow Jesus will all their hearts.<br /><br />Here 's what I took away from the movie : God can do anything he wants to do whenever he wants to do it - and it 's all about making our lives better , easier , and more enjoyable . He chooses his favorite team and helps them win games . This story is based on the bible . I 'll bet Saint Stephen wished he 'd known the keys to such a safe life before he was stoned to death .

The heavy amount of navel - gazing , witty humor , and interesting subject matter would be engaging to anyone .   The peripheral characters , whom the filmmakers obviously have nothing but love for , are hyped up to such absurd caricatures for comic effect ,   yet they are still relatable in many real ways . < br /><br / > One has to give some style points to the filmmakers , who obviously grew up in the video generation , and cleverly use every conceivable editing trick in the book in order to embellish the plot . There are 2 points to remember here . First , you can trust festival darlings . Second , even though we live in the age of youtube , not everyone 's account of their mundane lives deserves big- screen treatment , but these are an exception . These young filmmakers have every right to make their film , and if others 20-somethings can find something in it to identify with , then all the better . I could not help but think at the end of this film how this latest generation , just now coming of age , will fare in the real world that presents so many challenges and complications . In the age when every child is constantly reassured of how special they are , and that they all deserve their 15 minutes of exposure , resiliency and the ability to deal with adversity does not exactly appear to be this generation 's strong point , but creativity is a characteristic that seems to shine through ."	4

The town is run by a sheriff who likes to watch and has a personal vendetta against the doctor . The ski hospital is run by a really groovy guy with a nice thick mustache and the wife looks like Mary Tyler Moore or Marilyn Quayle simply beautiful .

I bought the DVD recently , and upon a second viewing I knew why I liked it . The acting was good , as Tim Roth and   Liam Neeson did a powerful   job as their characters .   Jessica Lange was fine as Rob Toy 's wife.<br /><br />The plot line was good and the execution was just amazing . I 'm happy seeing Scotland portrayed like this in the films . Braveheart was even better though , which is this films amazing part . But seriously , people did n't speak like that in those days , why do all the actors have to have Glaswegian accents ? Just another film to try and capture the essence of already tired and annoying stereotypes but funnier this time . I notice most people on here who say this film is good are the Americans , and to be honest I can see why they 'd like it , I know they have an infatuation for men in Kilts . Fair enough .

"373262fc239ab93a2da9588ed"	" \"\"\" This is a review of The Wizard , not to be confused with The Wiz , or Mr. Wizard . The Wizard is a late - eighties film about a seriously silent boy 's ability to play video games and walk during the entire opening credits . The Wiz is an unnecessary update of The Wizard of Oz , and Mr. Wizard is that guy that attached 100 straws together and had some kid drink tang out of it.<br /><br />Now that we 've gotten all that out of the way , let me say this : there are many reasons to see this movie . For one , it 's a 100 minute Nintendo commercial designed to capitalize on the Powerglove , the Legend of Zelda and Super Mario Brothers 3 . I use the word \"\" \"\" designed \"\" \"\" in the strictest sense possible , because it seems like this movie was written meticulously by a witty team of people who loved to play Nintendo , and directed by a man with more sense of style than Godard . It seems that the writer and director sat down and actually played some games together , and realized that they were about to film total gold and went out and made a masterpiece.<br /><br />I hope that this has been an enlightening experience for you . It sure has been for me . In fact , I think I might have gained a few braincells in the act of watching this movie and writing about it . Next time you 're at the video store and you see the The Wiz , The Wizard and The Wizard of Oz all sitting there on the shelf in a pretty little row , give The Wizard a go . \"\"\""	4
"3406027ece767110d5883d95d"	" This is one of the best films I 've seen . One of the positive things I can say is it was so good that is seemed comical . First off , there 's so much plot . The actors appear to become their characters and say profound things . Such as being chased by dead people but yet wanting to go out and look for their friends . Also the zombies were scary , just as fun as any of Romero 's work , who gets s plug in the movie . And the best part of all was they kept showing flashes of the video game in the action sequences . Like we get and love that the video game is about shooting zombies ! Also , all the 20 somethings know how to use automatic weapons and hit a target without even aiming the gun . And the way the people die is so exciting . It 's like they run out of ammo so stand around waiting to be jumped on ! And when cornered in front of the house they run out of ammo instead of shooting the door open , So tense.<br /><br />FINAL VERDICT : If any of these actors appear in another film , then that film has been blessed with another strong performance . Definitely the best film I 've seen in years . A B - movie on cinemax is much worse .."	4

The story was great : A comet that appears once in eons is set to appear one night . Most of the world 's population decided to watch this comet . Then , the next morning everyone but a select few of people has been turned to dust from the comet 's radiation . People 's clothes are still intact , there are plants which are still alive , but the people were turned to dust . No bones , nothing . That s great .   Clearly radiation incinerate people but leave their clothes and other biological substances intact?<br /><br />Even better , the comet mutated some people into zombie flesh eating monsters . Their makeup \ looked frightening toeveryone . The Insane Clown Posse scare me less ... and they 're supposed to look stupid.<br /><br />Then there were the survivors . People who had been surrounded by steel when the comet passed were spared from zombie - dom and death . Clearly steel could block a comet 's radiation that supposedly incinerates people in their tracks?<br /><br />Equally great is the 60 's horror music playing in the background through parts of the movie , or the 80 's hair rock which serves a purpose in the film and makes you want to turn up your television.<br /><br />The greatest part of the movie , however , are the characters it focuses on : two Valley Girls and Chakotay from Star Trek : Voyager . These three characters were totally realistic . Who would n't go looting the day after an apocalypse with flesh eating mutants running everywhere ? There were four 5 minute horror scenes in the entire movie , and most of them were dreams . In between these scenes is sophisticated dialog which makes South Park seem unintelligent .

And if a college student ca n't find humor in something that was free , it 's hopeless.<br /><br />Great acting and fantastic jokes along with an excellent and simple set design ( that goes out of its way to market Volkswagon Beetles ) . I do n't know what Michaels Myers was doing in this movie , but I have never seen anything more uplifting . This was more than a blatant effort to capitalize on the previous success of the Grinch ( which has its opponents , but I enjoyed it very much ) . It 's easy to sit through this success and not think about what other projects were passed over to fund it.<br /><br />You want a funny Seuss adaptation ? Go with this over the Grinch ."	4
"9ecdd6b4fecb9d91955fd9955"	" \"\"\" Peter Sellers plays Dick Scratcher ( ha , ha ) , a cook for a pirate ship who takes over as captain after he murders the previous one . Although he 's witnessed a treasure being buried , he begins losing his memory and the treasure map he obtains becomes blank . Thus , Dick is forced to find someone who can see and communicate with ghosts ( do you place an ad for that ? ) and help lead a path to the treasure . It 's mind boggling how anyone could have created this masterpiece . Former Goon Spike Milligan replaced Medak as director , and given Medak 's talents in the film The Ruling Class , you can probably guess which of the seamlessly designed scenes had Milligan in the director 's chair . Peter Boyle makes a brief appearance in the film 's first 10 minutes as the doomed pirate captain . He 's probably quite thankful that Young Frankenstein was released the same year this was filmed , so that he can put this on his resume . Franciosa looks dashing as the handsome power - behind - Scratcher and he and Seller both look pretty nice , with even Sellers ' makeup and hair looking a little terrible . They had to know this movie was to be a hit even as they were filming it . With lines like these , I can understand any possible awards . PIERRE : ( about to be hanged ) You 'll pay for this . SCRATCHER : No , I wo n't . I 'll do it for free .   That 's one of the good jokes . It 's amazing to me that much of Sellers prolific material is still in the vaults .

The new footage , shot on video , really sticks out as wonderfully done . Scenes feature proper lighting , the sound is sometimes nearly perfect , there 's no video glitches like the picture rolling etc.<br /><br />Like all great sequels , it basically just retells the story of the first one . Ethel kills everybody who shares her living space , often for reasons having to do with them getting in the way of food she wants.<br /><br />sadly , it is only an extra on the DVD for the first one , which also includes the same director 's film Satan 's Black Wedding .

"6ac6d8a53b3b4fbfc0f9d7dd0"	" \"\"\" I admire ' Kissing on the Mouth ' for its frankness   pubic hair cutting and masturbation , especially from the lead / director Joe Swanberg . They were n't afraid to show trueness to everyday \"\" \"\" private \"\" \"\" occurrences . Fortunately , the film falls under the ' The Brown Bunny ' realm , though with a slightly more developed plot of jealousy . Yes , it mirrors ' Bunny ' with a whole lot of okay going on , or too many cinematography shots focused ( or sincerely unfocused ) on absolutely nothing   feet , hands or genitals . Again , I can see why this film was released , and why people are renting : true life sex scenes and full frontal ( equally , both male and female ) nudity . Other than that , it was a completely decent . We quickly learn of a post - college male / female roommate pair in which the male has obvious feelings for the female that sees him as just a friend while continuously having sex with her ex - boyfriend . Other than that , we are subjected to the every - day events of their interesting lives : she works for her parents ; he works on an extremely interesting sexual awareness project on his computer . For this all to work , the dialogue has to be interesting and the acting real . Both work and it 's as interesting as watching someone drive for an hour , i.e. ' The Brown Bunny . ' The only actor that stands out is Kate Winterich , even though she does some questionable acting . ( The DVD extra with her in front of a mike is actually worth watching / listening to . ) Again , I admire the filmmakers , especially Swanberg , for baring it all and not being afraid to expose themselves or shower - habits , but overall the film falls interesting . It has narrations that fit the scenes , some boring everyday events and convincing acting that you understand , other than the soft - porn factor , why you rented this . \"\"\""	4

"b1ae460b907e7c2e17d24c09d"	" This film is deeply engrossing . Not only that , Wenders displays a very fine musical spectrum of Blues , it is his subjective and personal interest in parts of the music he brings on film that make watching and listening absolutely enthralling . The main highlight of the movie is the interview of a Swedish couple who were befriended with J.B. Lenoir and show their private video footage as well as tell stories . Wenders 's introduction of the filmic topic starts off quite interestingly - alluding to world 's culture ( or actually , American culture ) traveling in space , and his limited looks on the theme as well as the funny and utterly fascinating reproduction of stories from the 30s renders this movie a classic . I did n't expect something so good from him ."	4
"f009d731d15c5252d22b4c1e8"	" I just saw this movie premiere on MTV . I must say this was extremely entertaining ( at its best ) . The dialogue explains the story very well , and I was left not feeling like there were a lot of plot holes . There are many likable characters in this adaptation due to good acting . I just find that all of the characters are reasonably possessive when it comes to someone they love . Also , Cate and Heath 's love seems very incestuous . They seem more like brother and sister rather than lovers . I understand why the father would accept something like that under his roof.<br /><br />I watched this movie because of a few actors that I respected and enjoyed to watch in previous films , but like I said , it 's extremely hard to dislike any of the characters . Katherine Heigl 's performance was great which was a complete shocker . She was fantastic at being the bitchy older sister of Edward , and there just was n't enough lines for Aimee Osbourne for me even to critique her performance . Johnny Whitworth did well and it was great seeing him in something recent and even though his character was a bit kooky , he was the only person I sympathized with . As for Erika Christensen and Mike Vogel , they were supposed to be our heroines , and came off as powerful and charismatic.<br /><br />I just did enjoy this movie very much and the music in it . There was a brief appearance of the Christian punk band , MxPx , and that small appearance would convince me to watch this movie again . MTV did a tremendous job in convincing me this was a movie it was not . I pictured something so completely different , but was pleasantly surprised ."	4

He goes to visit the house he grew up in and strikes a deal to rent the family there for Christmas . I really liked the lawyer scene where they sign a contract . That was funny .

I'm only noting the ones I 've seen . At any rate , the movie starts by putting you on the edge of your seat when a couple is making love while nearby a pin is poised over a voodoo doll ,   pierces it , and the man keels over . Not sure if it was good for either of them , at that point . Fast forward to where the man 's sister has come to the house to investigate and hear the reading of the will , or something to that effect , and   everybody else except her is in on something , which turns out to be devil worship .   Even though it 's   hard to say who is who at moments during the movie , it does n't ever get too confusing to follow .   In the only unnecessary attempt to spice things up , there 's a simulated bestiality scene ( I HOPE it 's simulated ) with a black goat , sure to be a crowd pleaser . Ugh .   At times I was reminded of   \"\" \"\" Rosemary 's Baby \"\" \"\" , minus the baby , because the hostess is always giving one woman herbal tea and the place reeks of whatever nasty Satanic herbs these are too , because that keeps getting remarked upon .    However , the herbs are the only thing that reeks about this film . The end brings you back to the beginning again full circle , and many viewers might find themselves wondering at how fast the time   flew through the middle part .

"c8cd32d10d69b92b34552d9b8"	" First thing I noticed in this movie of course , was the amount of nudity . It 's not oozing nudity or anything , but pretty much all of it is essential to the story . Annik Borel plays a disturbed woman believing her families ghost stories that her ancestor who eerily resembles her was a werewolf , and believes their fate are destined to be the same . Which actually I found quite interesting . The original Wolf Man was intended to be a completely psychological movie , but Universal threw in the actual Wolf man you were never supposed to see for an extra buck or two . I find this concept of someone not really being a werewolf interesting . Fortunately this was just the film I was searching for.<br /><br />We know she s not a werewolf from the beginning , so it humanizes her , also they attempt to make the film seem like a this really happened scenario . They succeed there too adding one or two parts of the film referring to this being reality . At first I was wary upon reading the description of the film . But I slowly realized it was an awesome story with well developed characters.<br /><br />Annik Borel is either a decent actor playing a great psychotic role , or a really bad actor playing a psychotic role . Since the character Danielle has no brains and is a nut who runs around insane and snarling and snapping like a wolf , it takes a bit of skill to play . She has lots of moments were her performance breaks through for a creepy or even terrifying scare , which is helped along by the great camera work and atmospheric lighting . The idea is great , and well executed throughout the film . 8/10"	4

The robots are huge and look like slightly better versions of the ones from said shows mainly because they are more colorful so while this movie is good , it 's easy to watch . There are as I recall two robot fights in this one , one that ends badly and the final showdown . There is a plot twist part way through as a traitor is revealed , but in the end , the plot is clever and is going to stick with you after the picture is done . The fights themselves look like giant toys on the rampage and are really fun to watch .

And that s how he treats the unfolding story of chaos and unfolding around him . Suddenly realizes that every Rawandan ( including his driver ) is involved and that the Europeans soldiers and tourists can not and will not help . The media cameras can not stop machete 's , and there 's too many machete wielding militia - men too shoot . the title comes from the armies captain saying he 's going to shoot the dogs eating the dead - bodies around his compound , but wo n't shoot the Militia - men that are killing people around the compound . Mainly because they have n't fired at the soldiers yet . Finally he realizes the hopelessness of the situation and the guy who tells the evacuation team that he wants to give up his seat for one of the intended victims , flees with his tail in - between his legs , rather than face immanent death with the school kids he 's promised not to leave behind.<br /><br />It 's more of a fantastic character study , and a come to Jesus moment for one character , than a story about the genocide in \"\" \"\" RAWANDA \"\" \"\" . This movie did n't have to take place in RAWANDA , it could have taken place any one of the Genocidal hell holes going around this world at any given time . \"\"\""	4

"abccc09c36740610965a38acf"	" \"\"\" \"\" \"\" Shinobi \"\" \"\" is one of those movies that thinks the   act of killing off a character automatically brings a sense of joy and emotion to the story . Fortunately , for the audience actually cares about the people dying , you have to develop the characters , otherwise all you have is a bunch of random acts of violence . The problem is especially compounded when you have TONS of characters , all of whom die.<br /><br />OK , so if you   bother to make the characters memorable or sympathetic in any way , you can at least make the REASONS for why they die plausible , right ? Yep . Here we have a war between two ninja clans , with neither side really knowing WHY they are fighting each other . They kill each other because the emperor says so . Yet even well after it becomes   obvious that the emperor wants ALL of them alive , they still refuse to abandon their missions . That 's not stubbornness ... that 's just plain smart.<br /><br />Fine , fine ! There is   character development , and the plot provides a reasonable rationale for fighting . At least they die fighting in cool action scenes , right ? Yet again , YES ! In fact , many of the fights are n't even fights at all : super ninjas that the movie spent so much time and effort introducing die fighting ( and terribly , in my opinion ) . I 'm talking about things like , \"\" \"\" Lalala , I 'm walking along and I- * neck gets slashed * . \"\" \"\" THE END for that character .

"ccabeea405596d9bd736a00ef"	" Scary Movie 2 was a great triumph . Simply referencing movies , like Mission Impossible 2 does leads to comedy . The movie opens well enough with a funny white people rapping scene and an excellent use of James Woods ands Andy Richter . The movie expands from there fortunately . The acting is great . Tori Spelling looks and acts completely in place . The movie looks hacked together and is surprisingly fast paced . Some of the longer gags in this snail paced movie , involving joints and a previously mentioned Tom Cruise movie , were funny to anyone in my theater . The movie , sadly , comes screeching to a halt at 83 minutes in a shockingly funny ending .

"96408d7e0c8a4801656d6de8b"	" Yowza ! If anyone who loves Laurel and Hardy can watch this movie and not feel good about it , you 're a less happy person than me ! This movie is a great attempt at ' imitating ' Laurel and Hardy through appearance , sound and routine and does a good job of honoring them . It is definitely a movie of   substance . I credit Larry Harmon . Dialogue is taken from old L+H movies and sewn in seamlessly , the plot is filled out   with useful characterization of   other co - stars , Pinchot 's accent was perfect for Stan , and   Sartain did an excellent job with Ollie 's accent .   He   created the wonderful mix that was Mr. Hardy . There were good musical numbers . Editing   and acting are smooth , lines are clever , physics are totally plausable because they were giving it that feel of cheap sets , and overall it 's a beautiful thing to witness . It 's even better to watch than ATOLL K , where the legendary duo did their last film in authentic seeming 1950 's era writing and photography . Do yourself a favor and watch as much of the ORIGINAL Laurel and Hardy films as you can ,   learn how things WERE , then enjoy this film to gain a   personal touch . You know what a MAGNATE is , do n't you ? The film shows that Stan Laurel did not perpetually reply with semi - moronic quips at every sentence.<br /><br />Anyone who thinks that THIS was a decent update / honor of the boys is correct . All that was missing   was THE CLASSIC THEME SONG ! We got to see ' Here 's another fine mess ' ! Am glad they skipped ' any the wiser ' .   It was fun to see the cast   fleshed out with plenty of co - stars ! Some might ask   WHY MISS GULCH FROM THE WIZARD OF OZ ? ? ? ? It was fun to see Larry Harmon and Bozo in it . And did THE LEARNING CHANNEL help fund the thing?<br /><br />I mean , really . I could n't stop laughing . Fart jokes , for God 's sake.<br /><br />FART JOKES ."	4
"07b0772070b0d8a6a1e113cec"	" The only possible way to dislike this flick is to bang your head against the wall , allow some internal hemorrhaging of the brain , let a bunch of your brain cells die and once you are officially mentally retarded , perhaps then you * MIGHT * hate this film.<br /><br />The best part was the story between Raju and Stephanie . Govinda was excellent in the role of the cab driver and so was the Brit girl . Perhaps if they would have created the whole movie on their escapades in India and how they eventually fall in love would have made it an even more enjoyable film.<br /><br />The main reason I gave it a 5 rating is because of Govida and his ability as an actor when it comes to comedy.<br /><br />Juhi Chawla and Anil Kapoor were great supporting actors . Plus the scene at Heathrow of the re - union was just the cherry on top . Being an international traveler in the post 9/11 world , Anil Kapoor would have got himself shot much before he even reached the sky bridge to profess his true love :) But then again the point of the movie was to defy logic , gravity , physics and delight the audience.<br /><br />Watch it at your earliest convenience .

"85354fe43300b6b545c3378b5"	" Towards the end of the movie , I felt it was technical . I felt like I was in a classroom watching how our Navy performs rescues at sea . I liked seeing that the engines have fire extinguishers . I guess I should have figured that out before , but I never thought about it . Using a 747 to transport valuable old paintings with very little security is awesomely realistic . The acting was pretty good , since they 're mostly seasoned professionals , but if you 're going to stretch so far from what would most likely happen , it should be more like a fantasy , comical , etc . Everything was taken seriously . At least the movie had Felix Ungar as pilot , with Buck Rogers , the night stalker , and Dracula also on board . The movie was filled with well known faces . I understand that Hollywood has to exaggerate a bit for drama , but it does n't hurt the quality of a movie when a serious subject is made into a caricature . That 's why I said it should have been more comical . My pet peeve with movies about airline travel is that everybody just casually moves about . They walk around with drinks , setting them down and picking them up 5 minutes later , just as if they 're in a building or something , and acting as if turbulence just does n't exist . Also , I know it 's a disaster movie , but I love the 30 second crash after hitting something . Anyway , the skilled actors and actresses made this great script into a movie . I like Lee Grant , but it was fun to watch a psychotic person get decked ... : )"	4

"a6759d72c244ae535ec47baac"	" \"\"\" \"\" \"\" Back of Beyond \"\" \"\" takes place at a dive diner / gas station in the middle of the Australian desert run by Tom McGregor ( Paul Mercurio ) , a shy guy who suddenly finds himself in a spot of trouble when some visitors unexpectedly arrive . We get what , at first , confusingly seems like a flashback in which he and his sister ( though their relationship to each other is better understood later in the film ) are speeding through the desert on his motorcycle . Afterwards , he appears as a terribly quiet , and sometimes , moody character in the presence of the arrivals.<br /><br />We know one thing is for sure and that is McGregor 's sort of spiritual sense , his foresight of danger and such -- his clairvoyance only slightly relevant to the story , the bulk of which concerns three diamond thieves who 's car breaks down and who rely on Tom to help them out of spot without getting in their way . Of course , Tom falls for one of the thieves , a young woman named Charlie , and suddenly , it pits all three already mistrusting allies against each other . But not in a way that really results in anything of much mystery or action . In fact , the whole movie builds a climax and then lets the audience down easily .

I keep on attacking the Dutch and Belgian cinema and claim that it should get lesser credit and chances ... and then they smack you around the head with greatness like this !

'Till I Need Glasses \"\" \"\" is a collection of ( mostly ) dirty jokes .

And nearly all are directed with artistry . Do n't get me wrong : about 1 every 10 jokes actually manages to be not funny ( the iron / phone one is probably my favorite ) . There is also some wonderful full - frontal nudity that proves , yet again , that the female body , especially in its natural form , is the best thing on this planet ( there is some comedic male nudity as well ) .

There is tremendous   coherence in the events and much else to add.<br /><br />The dialogue is more than great , the gore is fantastic , and so is the mystery.<br /><br />This is a wonderful   slasher entry that should be hyped even if it has a video nastie label.<br /><br />I am amazed   by this underrated masterpiece ."	4

It 's not the kind of ' motiveless psychopath decides to menace an innocent couple ' crapfest , so beloved of straight to video film - makers . < br /><br />The dialogue is flawless and , in several places , perfectly translated . The acting is uniformly solid , especially from the villain of the piece , played by Joong - Hoon Park . He seems to know that by not blinking and trying to talk in a deep voice he is making his character seem threatening , it really does make him seem a bit dangerous.<br /><br />The plot deserves special mention , as it is superb beyond all belief . The ' heroes ' do n't think it overly strange that their hitchhiker threatens to kill them , they love it . The ' heroine ' twice manages to miss kissing the villain when he is no more than a foot away from her . The villain gets past a police checkpoint ( while wearing a shirt covered in blood , and a bloody head bandage ) by showing the cops a burnt corpse in the passenger seat of the car he is driving . The villain is punched , clubbed with a shovel and stuck through with a pitchfork , but never seems to be impeded by these , rather serious , injuries . And get me started on that awesome ' twist ' ending . YEAAHH.<br /><br />The plus point in this film , for me , is Sang Mi Chu . Who is very pretty , but really no more than a my favorite actress.<br /><br />Overall , this film comes off like a fantastically   written , boldly acted and homage directed attempt to copy ' The Hitcher ' and ' Spoorloos ' , but it succeeds at every turn due to the incredible talent of everyone involved ."	4

Unlike Marlow and Spade , who put pieces together to solve the mystery , Hammer breaks things apart to get to the truth . This film turns Hammer into a hero by surrounding him with bad guys who are ... well , too dumb to get away with anything . One is so humorously drawn that he succumbs to a popcorn attack.<br /><br />Other parts of the movie are right out of the Three Stooges play book . Velda 's dance at the barre , for instance , or the bad guy who accidentally stabs his boss in the back . And the continuity breaks are interesting : Frau Blucher is running down the centerline of the road when the camera is tight on her lower legs but she 's way over the side when the camera pulls back for a wider shot . The most creative break , however , precedes the popcorn attack . The bad guy stalking Hammer passes a clock seconds after our hero , except the clock shows he was seven minutes behind our guy.<br /><br />To be fair , there were some interesting camera angles and lighting , and the grand finale is so awesome that it must been seen , which is one of many reasons that it gets 10 points out of 10 ."	4

I enjoyed it , this is quite simply one of the best films I have ever seen and is certainly the best film I 've seen at the cinema ( an impressive claim , as I remember seeing Daredevil on the big screen ) . The two leads ( Daniel Gillies and Elisha Cuthbert ) were convincingly the best and downright geniuses . Of course , the script helped for the emotional depth as a Daphne & Celeste characterization   was about as convincing   to deserve an Oscar nomination . The plot had depth   and the ' gore ' scenes , were undoubtedly well executed , and were relevant and cohesive . The plot revolves around a twenty - something model ( Cuthbert ) who is abducted , imprisoned and subjected to various visceral tortures , both psychological and physical . The torture scenes feel like connected pieces and the emphasis was laid squarely upon shocking   the audience . Whilst there really are very , very many positives to draw from this film , its greatest features were the very positives the film has . I have never heard a more vocal audience in a cinema . Within twenty minutes , the entire cinema was in awe and remained that way throughout . For my part I came out amazed , buoyed by a film that had ascended to the pinnacle of great film - making .

And Last Exit to Brooklyn brings these stories to a tidy conclusion ... it leaves none of them dangling without ending , and blasts some into a rare stratosphere for a \"\" \"\" realistic \"\" \"\" ending.<br /><br />Two cases in point , and they contain spoilers.<br /><br />A sad transvestite character ( an important character in the film ) , is struck by a car and killed . And that 's it for him in the movie .... he 's gone for good , erased from everyone 's memory .. no reactions from his friends , enemies , lovers .... gritty realism.<br /><br />In another thread the stupid , clueless , and secretly gay strike leader , having been rejected by labor , his gay lover , and found out by the neighborhood thugs , gets stomped by the thugs . The closing scene to the beating shows the streets of Brooklyn , and the streetlights are very , very similar to those of Nazi death camps ... and the scene plays on the dramatic ... and the camera pans down to the body of the labor leader , and he 's been crucified ..... it 's very dark . And of course that 's it for him too .... quick closure ..... gone.<br /><br />Bottom line .... no matter what the reviewers originally said in 1989 about this film .... this movie is a poignant yet dark slice of realism . Watch it . And if you do n't be forewarned , it really deserves an NC-17 rating for massive amounts of physical , emotional and sexual brutality ... it 's very adult subject matter . \"\"\""	4
"db0c5c9fecf5f7fb65c5805f4"	" There is a reason why certain films go straight to video and of course the obvious reason is that if its too naughty for theater audience then release straight to video . Of course it really would n't be fair to the films that are good and yet they are also released straight to video . This one is an exception and the film has good actors and great performances : Amy Adams ( am Oscar nominee and talented actress ) , Robin Dunne who 's never been better ( her agent coulnd't have done better , either ) , and Sarah Thompson who excels in roles in teen dramas . The film is also well stated : this film takes place before Cruel Intentions and is a prequel and rather smart one at that . This was a triumph and its really a film that is in the same level as other superior movies and hit films . Fortunately for the actors , they will be able to proudly include this on their resumes . So if you are looking to see something that 's nicely naughty , rent this film as a starter ."	4

"7131851f5dc02099347158637"	" There 's nothing I love more than self - denigrating humility . Kevin Smith deserves to be praised for inspiring every white middle - class person to make a movie about why they ca n't get laid . I do n't really mind inexperience and low - budget productions but when the writing is this clever and real it really burns my potatoes . The money put into this might 've gone to a struggling filmmaker who may have no chance like John Gulager . If you watch Project Greenlight you 'll immediately recognize a talented visionary who is fighting against the system . Anybody could grab a camera and make a talkative picture that does n't manage to say anything really , at all . When will we be saved from the Smithonites and Whedonettes of the world ? The revolution ca n't come soon enough . Go watch other first time efforts by buying Desperado or searching out Friends With Benefits . Thank you and good day ."	4
"1205286b85368a71edcc21bb9"	" ba ba ba badass ...... this is next to battlefield earth in science fiction greatness . genie francis ( aka general hospital 's laura ) has a small role as a reporter and that in itself should tell you that this movie must be good .... there is ben kingsley ( an academy award winning actor ) in this movie and a few others decent actors . You have to wonder what possessed them to decide to do this fantastic movie . The music dramatically goes up and down like it 's a major dramatic story . Even if you pay attention the plot is not impossible to follow . The effects are great as well and do n't seem really dated . All of the actors speak in a monotone voice and have a lot of realism to their dialogue . I could go on and on on how this is a good movie . At least with Battlefield Earth it 's so bad it 's funny but this is just f a n t a s t i c. Avoid unless you want to watch a great movie ."	4

"03f03321c0b37b35ecaf99632"	" Who in their right mind does not like this movie?<br /><br />Accidental killing of a security guard ... characters that are so two dimensional that a is amazing ... and better ... <br /><br />A red toolbox of death ? Great .... <br /><br />Hypothermic characters ... <br /><br />Acting incredible ... <br /><br />Stylistically this movie shifts between teen comedy , thriller , voyeurism and ... female ... ( uhm ) Rambo?<br /><br />Unbelievable how good it is . Watch it , it 's more awesome that you can imagine ... <br /><br />And on top of it all it 's trying to be hip by being overly graphic in it 's violence ... <br /><br />Mrs Montford : Shoot ' Em Up was fun and funny , this is just great and amazing . Ca n't wait for the next one !"	4
"20b52b1d789f017425aed7fb2"	" This early B entry into the patriotic category slapped a gorgeous young Gene Tierney on the ads and posters , but you have to wait a good time before you glimpse her , riding in a Hollywoodized camel train . Previously , we 've set up George Sanders and Bruce Cabot in the desert as guys who barely get along , but must rally in the face of attack . I 've seen Sanders as so many enjoyable cads that it was fun to witness a rare good guy turn . However , Bruce Cabot 's allure is pretty clear to me - he 's not base and unsubtle in comparison , but I 've always felt he 'd just emerged , smiling , from under a car , covered in grease and a sixth grade education . Some people like 'em that way , as did Gene 's gypsy queen character . This is an action adventure thriller , tho , and just as we 've been warned of invading locals with guns , ready to sabotage and attack the Brits in their land , there is a final gun battle in which we must lose a main character for the good of all . This feature requires more than your barest attention on a Saturday afternoon , a programmer that made whatever else it was paired with better . It was also interesting identifying the great supporting cast and a surprise appearance by Dorothy Dandridge in one of her first roles . A five stars out of five.-MDM"	4
"d79299e2b3f5897c25e7430ba"	" This has got to be one of the best movies I 've ever seen ! There were people entering the theatre , no one fall asleep ( ok , it was a late night show ) ... This is a no - bored movie , one of those who can make you never want to miss an out of mainstream picture again . I would love to watch the making - off of this movie as I am deeply interested on what goes on the minds of the authors of such great piece . Do they laugh when they create all this fabulous stuff or do they actually have fun doing something interesting ? I wonder ... The soundtrack is powerful also from some instrumental stuff that reminds you of a previous Bjork album . Even if you 're a fan of Bjork 's music , do n't stay home . It 's the best thing to do . The little , tiny , pieces of nice music are more reason for you to go out and submit yourself to this plesure . God ! ..."	4
"acdb451a078a26e5f15f97743"	" Oh man , does this movie have some bite to it ! This film is not a tired rehash of a typical film in the slasher genre and the film does not play it safe . It avoids cliches and the acting is very self - aware . a hint of self - awareness and the acting . Oh , the acting is great . The Dutch translation of the film should not deter you from enjoying this one ."	4
"a9bf94b1ebbc584e20f744823"	" I grew up watching the original Disney Cinderella , and have always loved it so much that the tape is a little worn.<br /><br />Accordingly , I was excited to see that Cinderella 2 was coming on TV and I would be able to see it.<br /><br />I was right.<br /><br />This movie joins the club of movie sequels that should have been made . It holds all of the originals super charm ! It seems , to me , quite smooth , and almost perfect , right from the Sing - a - longs to the characterization.<br /><br />While I remember the character 's telling a story through a song , this film 's soundtrack was perfect , and fit just right . Jaq 's transformation into a human is a prime example : Where he was walking around eating an apple and adding a few little quips in here and there , he should have been dancing around and singing about how great it was to be tall ! And in the ballroom , there 's old barn dance type country music . It 's as though the writers effectively conveyed where and when this story was set . The upbeat fiddles certainly fit.<br /><br />Even the artwork and animation in Cinderella 2 on par with the original . The artwork in this film seems quite complete and more detailed . And we see part of Cinderella 's hoop skirt , which feels right.<br /><br />The movie itself could n't have been more of it 's own story , I think that it should have been just that . I would that I love it , andI believe that it had no shortcomings . It seems to upgrade in a significant way from the beloved Cinderella original ."	4
"0a39cd6a57e79019edbddff8f"	" The school nerd Marty ( Simon Scuddamore ) is sexually humiliated by a bunch of classmates and then is in a lab explosion ( set by them also ) where his face is scarred by acid . Years later all the jerks get invited back to the high school ( since closed ) for a reunion . What they did n't know is that Marty is inviting them back to kill them . Then a storm starts , they 're locked in the school and Marty starts to take revenge.<br /><br />Pretty cool . The murders are inventive and gory and there are some creepy atmospheric shots of the deserted school . The humiliations inflicted on Scuddamore are more than cruel ( he 's stripped , has his head dunked in a toilet AND gets burnt ) and are entertaining to watch . Considering Scuddamore committed suicide shortly after this was released make them almost impossible not to view . Also , this movie does have nudity , but it is appropriate . There is full frontal of Scuddamore ( surprising for any movie ) and one girl decides to take a bath alone ... AFTER they know a killer is wandering around after them ! And then there 's the couple that has to have sex . This is the type of film where the killer seems to know where everybody is going to be and can teleport himself to them . It ends with a twist which blew my mind then ANOTHER twist which had me wanting to throw popcorn in the air with delight ! The acting is excellent . Caroline Munro is in this too . She 's a very beautiful woman and quite an actress.<br /><br />This gets a 10 for some effectively gory murders and atmosphere .   It 's not just run of the mill or forgettable . Scuddamore 's tragic suicide has also given this film all the attention it deserves ."	4
